= To Find Asset Information
:imagesdir: ./_images

When you click an asset, the right detail panel lists the asset type, when the asset was created and by which organization, when the asset was last published, the version, and the asset's dependencies. 

In a REST API, click a method and the right detail panel lets you send requests to the API and view the responses. Additional pages appear in the left navigation bar.

== Exchange Search

Search lets you find Exchange assets that contain one or more terms in an asset title, 
asset ID, or a tag in an asset. 

When searching for an asset, Exchange does not interpret regular expression keywords 
that you specify but instead searches for the term you specify.

Searches only apply to the Exchange you are viewing, that is, searching in a private Exchange only lists
private Exchange assets and not public Exchange assets.

In Exchange 2.1, assets migrated from Exchange 1 allow the search to include text in the description.

== Saved Search

Exchange lets you save searches. Administrators can save searches available to everyone in an organization. These 
search values appear in the left navigation area after you log into an organization.

=== Multiple Word Searches

You can put a space between words to search for 
case insensitive text that begins with each word you specify. 
This is similar to putting the `*` wildcard regular expression after each word.
For example searching for `mq module` finds any asset that has text that 
starts with `mq` or `module`.

Each word in a multiple word phrase need to be present in an asset 
for the search to succeed.

If you separate search words with any other character than a space, Exchange 
converts the character to a space before searching.

== Testing REST API Elements

. In the left navigation area you can view RAML or OAS API specification information such as resources and the methods in each resource. Click a method button to view information about the API:

+
. Use the right side of a method view to experiment with the API. This functionality is similar to what you can expect in programs such as Postman where you can specify custom HTTP headers and test each API's method using the API's endpoint.
. Click Request Access to tie the API you're viewing to one of your applications so that you can use the API to send and receive data that your application can consume.

== Viewing and Trying an API with API Notebook

. Click API Notebook in the content page if one is available for the API.
. After you read the description for usage information, you can experiment with the example in the code block to try different parameters and values, and see the results in real time.
. Click Play to test the method in the code example and view the results.

== Viewing Assets by Business Group

Anypoint Platform provides the option for business groups that organize content into categories. 

In Anypoint Exchange, different assets may appear in each business group. Each organization 
chooses which assets are in each business group.

If you cannot find 
an asset in one group, it may be in another business group. If you cannot view a business group, contact your site's administrator.

To change business groups, click a group name from the taskbar.
