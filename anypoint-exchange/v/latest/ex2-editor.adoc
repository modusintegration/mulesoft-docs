= To Edit An Asset Description
:keywords: exchange, editor, edit

To describe your asset, click Edit image:ex2-edit-pencil-icon.png[ex2-edit-pencil-icon].

You can use the Exchange editor with either Visual or Markdown editing controls.

link:/anypoint-exchange/ex2-delete[Need to delete or deprecate an asset?]

*Notes:* 

* You have to save an initial draft of your description before you can add pages. After you save the draft 
and return to edit mode, then you can add pages.
* If your Exchange session times out while you're editing, select all the text on the page and copy it to your 
clipboard. Then after you log back in, you can paste the content back into the page and save your draft. When a timeout occurs, unsaved content is purged.
* If you are editing descriptions for many assets, instead of clicking an asset to open it from Exchange, instead right-click the asset and click Open Link in New Window to open the asset in a new browser window. Otherwise, after you publish an asset, control returns to the start of the filter/search list.

== To Use the Visual Editor

Exchange lets you type descriptions of your asset. You can access international characters by pressing and holding a character.

The Exchange Visual editor provides these formats:

To use the link control, type text, select the text, and click the link control to specify the link URL.

The image control only works with graphics served by a web server such as those on the internet.

Anypoint Exchange uses link:https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/[GitHub Markdown]. Everything works in GitHub Markdown except for syntax highlighting, which is not supported in Exchange.

*Note:* Raw HTML code is not supported.

*Note:* If you have a shortened YouTube URL, be sure to add the asset ID to a youtube/embed URL before adding the
statement to your asset description. For example, you would convert `+https://youtu.be/EhJM1GawQec+` to `+![](https://www.youtube.com/embed/EhJM1GawQec)+` to create the proper Exchange Markdown statement.

== To Add and Delete Pages in Exchange

In Exchange, you can add pages to your asset description to organize its content. For example, you can have subordinate pages to cover release notes or options. 

In the left navigation bar, click Add New Page to create a new page. Click the page name to open the new page. Page names are case sensitive and valid characters for a page name are: `a-z A-Z 0-9 -`. However, spaces, symbols other than dash, and international characters are not allowed in a page name. 

Note: A page name cannot contain an ampersand character (&#38;).

You can delete a page by clicking the trash can symbol: image:ex2-trashcan-delete-icon.png[ex2-trashcan-delete-icon]. 

Confirm the delete when prompted.
