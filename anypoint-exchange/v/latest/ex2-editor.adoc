= To Edit An Asset Description
:keywords: exchange, editor, edit

To describe your asset, click Edit image:ex2-edit-pencil-icon.png[ex2-edit-pencil-icon].

You can use the Exchange editor with either Visual or Markdown editing controls.

Need to delete an asset?  See link:/anypoint-exchange/ex2-add-asset#to-delete-an-asset[To Delete an Asset].

*Note:* You have to save an initial draft of your description before you can add pages. After you save the draft 
and return to edit mode, then you can add pages.

== To Use the Visual Editor

Exchange lets you type descriptions of your asset. You can access international characters by pressing and holding a character.

The Exchange Visual editor provides these formats:

The image control only works with graphics served by a web server such as those on the internet.

== To Add and Delete Pages in Exchange

In Exchange, you can add pages to your asset description to organize its content. For example, you can have subordinate pages to cover release notes or options. 

In the left navigation bar, click Add New Page to create a new page. Click the page name to open the new page. Page names are case sensitive and valid characters for a page name are: `a-z A-Z 0-9 -`. However, spaces, symbols other than dash, and international characters are not allowed in a page name.

You can delete a page by clicking the trash can symbol: image:ex2-trashcan-delete-icon.png[ex2-trashcan-delete-icon]. 

Confirm the delete when prompted.
