Anypoint Platform supports multiple business groups that you can use in Exchange.

However you cannot add assets between organizations or between business groups in different organizations.

To view business groups, click your organization name in the Exchange task bar. You can click other business groups in your organization to access each.

To add a business group, use Access Management > Organization. Click the plus sign next to a business group name to add a new business group.
