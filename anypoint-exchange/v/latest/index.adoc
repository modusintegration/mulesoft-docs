Anypoint Exchange consists of a MuleSoft provided public list of APIs, examples, connectors, and templates 
that you can use to create applications. 

Organizations can also have private Exchanges that list their APIs, examples, connectors, 
templates, and custom assets for creating applications 
within their organization.  Private Exchange assets enable Anypoint Platform users to publish and 
access Mule-related content within their own organization increasing visibility and reuse.

MuleSoft certifies its public content, and reviews and approves partner connectors. All private content is internal to an organization and not visible outside their organization. Customers are responsible for any private content they publish within their Exchange.
