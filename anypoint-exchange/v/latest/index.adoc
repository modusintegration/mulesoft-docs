= Anypoint Exchange

Anypoint Exchange helps you create API developer portals, view and test APIs, add mocking services to APIs, create assets, and use API Notebooks that describe and test API functions. 

== Get Started

. From the public https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange], click an asset and view its description. 
. Click Login to view a private Exchange for your organization. 
. After you log in, click Public Portal in your organization to view public APIs available to anyone.

After you log into Exchange, you can create assets for APIs, connectors, templates, examples, API Notebooks, and custom assets. 

== Try APIs

. Click All Types > REST APIs and choose any API. 
. Click the asset and notice how the API functions appear in the left 
navigation area. Exchange lets you view the functions in an API. 
. Click a function and more information appears. At the right side of the screen, you can test the API by entering sample values to send to the API and get responses from the API. 

== Need More Information on an Asset?

Click the Helpful Links item in the left navigation area for links to documentation.

== About Content

Exchange assets are accessible in Anypoint Studio (connectors, templates, and examples), API Manager and Runtime Manager (APIs), and you can publish APIs from Design Center to Exchange.

MuleSoft certifies its public content, and reviews and approves partner connectors. All private content is internal to an organization and not visible outside their organization. Customers are responsible for any private content they publish within their Exchange.
