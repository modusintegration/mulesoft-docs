== Anypoint MQ Workflow

The steps that follow help you use Anypoint MQ. This same workflow is described in the link:/anypoint-mq/mq-tutorial[Anypoint MQ Tutorial].

To install and configure Anypoint MQ:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform] using your
[Enterprise Mule credentials].
. Click *MQ* from Anypoint Platform.
. Click *Access Management* > *Users* or *Roles* to create an MQ user or role.
. From *MQ*, create a link:/anypoint-mq/mq-queues[queue], link:/anypoint-mq/mq-exchanges[message exchange], or a link:/anypoint-mq/mq-queues#fifoqueues[FIFO queue].
. Click a queue or message exchange name in the detail to access the Message Sender to send messages to a queue or message exchange, and to use the Message Browser to get messages from a queue.
. From *MQ*, click *Client Apps* to register an application. You can view the client ID and client secret for the application.
. In Anypoint Studio:
.. Install the MQ connector using Anypoint Exchange.
.. Create a new Mule project with needed building blocks, such as an HTTP connector, Anypoint MQ connector, Set Payload, and a Logger.
.. Configure the Anypoint MQ connector and provide the Client ID and Secret of the application you specified in Anypoint Platform > MQ.
.. Set the MQ connector's *Operation* to publish or consume messages, or to manually ack (accept a message) or nack (don't accept a message). Alternatively to ack or nack, Anypoint MQ can provide link:/anypoint-mq/mq-ack-mode[automatic Acknowledgement Mode]. If you set the Operation to publish, set the Destination to the name of a queue or message exchange that you created in Anypoint Platform. If you sent the Operation to consume, specify the name of a queue from which you want to receive messages.
.. Run the Mule application.
. Use a REST client such as Postman to send or receive a message.
+
The Anypoint MQ application sends the string as a message to the queue or message exchange you specified.
+
. View your message in a browser or the Studio console.
