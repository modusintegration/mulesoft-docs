= To Create a New Project

This procedure launches the new project and generates a Main flow with an HTTP Listener, an APIkit Router, and references to flows to handle APIkit errors and support REST resources and methods. The RAML file you imported resides in `src/main/api`. These flows, aptly called skeleton flows, are the bare minumum needed to support the RAML specification.
