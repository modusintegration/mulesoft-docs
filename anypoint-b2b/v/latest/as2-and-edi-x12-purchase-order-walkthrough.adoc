= AS2 and EDI X12 Purchase Order WalkThrough
:keywords: b2b, as2, edi, x12, dataweave

This page shows how a company can use Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) to manage and track B2B processes.
You will develop a Mule application that:

. Transforms an XML purchase order read from the company's filesystem to an X12 850 document
. Sends the 850 to a supplier over AS2
. Listens for (on an AS2 endpoint) and receives an X12 997 document that identifies whether the 850 was accepted or rejected

APM manages and records all B2B exchanges.

== Setting up a Partnership

The first step in building the solution is to create a partnership in Anypoint Partner Manager between your organization and a supplier.

NOTE: In this walkthrough, we show an example in which you initiate an order from a supplier, but APM works equally well when a customer is ordering from you.

A partnership:

* Identifies your company
* Identifies your partner
* Establishes the parameters by which B2B data is exchanged between you and your partner
* Allows this data to be tracked and viewed from Anypoint Partner Manager

=== Copy your Environment ID

. On the <<anypoint-partner-manager.adoc#img-apm-start,B2B Transactions Page>>, in the left-hand navigation pane, click *Administration*, then click *Environments*.
. In the row that corresponds to the environment with which you are working, click *copy*.


=== Identify or Create an API Key

In order to create a Mule project, you must enter an link:/anypoint-b2b/glossary#secta[API Key] and an environment ID.

If you have an existing API Key, use it. If you do not know the API Key, consult your organization's MuleSoft administrator.

If your organization has not created an API Key, you can use APM to create one.

WARNING: The API Key is used by every Mule application across your entire Master link:/access-management/organization[Organization] that communicates with Anypoint Partner Manager. Therefore, before you create a new API Key, coordinate with your organization's MuleSoft administrator to ensure that none of your organization's processes are using an existing API Key because, if they are, creating a new API Key will cause them to cease functioning. In that case, instead of creating a new API Key, use the existing API Key.

To obtain a key, see link:/anypoint-b2b/security#create-a-new-api-key[Create a New API Key].


You can determine your environment ID on the same page that you create a new API key.

== Setting up an Anypoint Studio Project

For information about using Anypoint Studio, see link:/anypoint-studio/[Anypoint Studio].

. Download link:_attachments/as2-x12-walkthrough.zip[as2-x12-walkthrough.zip].
. In Anypoint Studio, click *File*. +
The File Menu appears.
. On the File Menu, click *Import*. +
The Import Source Selection Window appears.
. In the Import Source Selection Window, select *Anypoint Studio generated Deployable Archive (.zip)*.
. Click *Next*. +
The Import Mule Project Window appears.
. In the Import Mule Project Window, browse to the location to which you downloaded the archive (in Step 1), then select the archive and click *Open*. +
The *Project Name* box auto-populates. +
NOTE: The Project Name must be unique with respect to any previously-imported projects. If it is not, *Finish* will not be enabled. If this is the case, change the Project Name so that *Finish* is enabled.

. Click *Finish*. +
The project appears in the Anypoint Studio Package Explorer pane.
. In the project (expand if necessary), expand the *src/main/app*, double-click *mule-app.properties*. +
Project properties appear in the Anypoint Studio Canvas.
. In Line 1, *api.key = NEED_TO_FILL_IN*, replace *NEED_TO_FILL_IN* with the API Key from <<Identify or Create an API Key>>.
. In Line 2, *environment.id = NEED_TO_FILL_IN*, replace *NEED_TO_FILL_IN* with the environment ID  from <<Copy your Environment ID>>.
. In Anypoint Studio, click *File*, then click *Save All*.

== Running the Application

. In Anypoint Studio, right-click the project.
. On the right-click menu, click *Run As*, then click *Mule Application*. +
On startup, the application creates an *outbox* folder in the project’s root directory. If the *outbox* directory isn’t visible, refresh the project in the *Package Explorer* view.
. The project includes a file named link:_attachments/as2-x12-po.xml[po.xml] in  the *src/test/resources* folder. Copy *po.xml*, then paste it in the *outbox* folder. +
The application processes the pasted file, then deletes it.
. In Anypoint Manager, in the left navigation pane, click *Transaction Monitoring* +
The xref:img-transaction-monitoring[] appears. +

[[img-transaction-monitoring]]
image::transaction-monitoring.png[img-transaction-monitoring,title="Transaction Monitoring Page"]

The xref:img-transaction-monitoring[] should confirm that:

* An XML purchase order was read from the company's filesystem and transformed to an X12 850 document.
* The 850 was sent to a supplier over AS2.
* The link:/anypoint-b2b/as2-connector[AS2 Connector]
 listened for (on an AS2 endpoint) and received an X12 997 document that identifies whether the 850 was accepted or rejected.
