* <<Overview>>
* <<Installing the Connector>>
* <<Configuring the Connector>>
* <<Supported Operations>>

== Overview

PMC provides connectivity to Anypoint Partner Manager (APM). The connector allows the management of APM-enabled connectors from APM and tracking of B2B exchanges.

== Installing the Connector

Follow the steps below to install the PMC in Anypoint Studio.

. On the *Help* menu in Anypoint Studio, select *Install New Software...* to bring up the *Available Software* dialog box.
. Press the *Add...* button, next to the *Work with* selection box, to add the PMC's update site.
. Once added, expand the Premium drop-down and choose *Partner Manager Connector*.
. Click *Next >*. The *Install Details* page appears.
. Review the details of the item you selected and click *Next >*.
. Accept terms and conditions of the product and press *Finish*.
. Click *Restart Now* to complete the installation.

== Configuring the Connector

. <<Configuration without file persistence>>
. <<Configuration using Amazon S3 for file persistence>>
. <<Configuration using a Mule flow for file persistence>>

=== Configuration without file persistence

. From Anypoint Studio, select the *Global Elements* view and press *Create*.
. Enter _Partner Manager_ in the filter.
. Choose *Basic Configuration* and click *OK*.
. In the *API Key* attribute, enter your private API key which is generated from APM portal.
. Enter in the *Environment ID* attribute the CloudHub environment you want PMC to run in.
. Press *OK*.

=== Configuration using Amazon S3 for file persistence

. From Anypoint Studio, select the *Global Elements* view and press *Create*.
. Enter _Partner Manager_ in the filter.
. Choose *Amazon S3 File Storage* and click *OK*.
. In the *API Key* attribute, enter your private API key which is generated from APM portal.
. Enter in the *Environment ID* attribute the CloudHub environment you want PMC to run in.
. Enter the settings of the S3 bucket to be used for storing files. These settings are obtained from your AWS console.
. Press *OK*.

=== Configuration using a Mule flow for file persistence

. From Anypoint Studio, select the *Global Elements* view and press *Create*.
. Enter _Partner Manager_ in the filter.
. Choose *Custom File Storage* and click *OK*.
. In the *API Key* attribute, enter your private API key which is generated from APM portal.
. Enter in the *Environment ID* attribute the CloudHub environment you want PMC to run in.
. Type in the name of the flow to be used for persisting files in the *Flow Name* attribute.
. Optionally, inside the File URL attribute, set a MEL expression to read the file URL from the message produced by the flow.
. Press *OK*.

== Supported Operations

The connector supports the following operations:

. <<Track Transmission>>
. <<Track Document>>
. <<Track Error>>
. <<Resolve Routes>>
. <<Start Transactions Replay>>
. <<End Transactions Replay>>

=== Track Transmission

Track transmissions originating from sources other than APM-enabled connectors like
the filesystem. User-defined metadata can also be tracked as part of the transmission.
The connector expects metadata to be a _java.util.Map_. Nested maps represent nested metadata.
You have the option to define the map inline via the *Object Browser*, or alternatively,
specify from the attribute its location in the Mule message. The reserved key "label" can be used in
metadata to label a transmission. A transmission label allows you to easily distinguish
between different transmissions in APM portal.

=== Track Document

Track documents like XML documents. The _Document_ attribute must be set accordingly
for APM to inspect the document and perform tasks such as property extraction.
User-defined metadata can also be tracked as part of the document. The connector expects metadata to be
a _java.util.Map_. Nested maps represent nested metadata. You have the option to
define the map inline via the *Object Browser*, or alternatively, specify from the attribute its location in the
Mule message.  The reserved key "label" can be used in metadata to label a document.
A document label allows you to easily distinguish between different documents in APM portal.

=== Track Error

Track errors originating from the processing of transactions, documents, transmissions,
or business processes. The origin of the error is selected from source attribute and
the ID identifying the source is set in the _Source ID_ attribute.

=== Resolve Routes

Fetch routes that have a source channel matching the document type and transport type.
An empty _java.util.List_ is returned if no routes could be found.

=== Start Transactions Replay

Fetch replayable transactions and set them as replaying. Replaying transactions that have timed out
and are identified as such through the _Replaying Timeout_ attribute are included with the result set.

=== End Transactions Replay

Mark transactions, identified by the entered list of transaction IDs, as replayed.

=== Search

Search a resource using APM's query language.
