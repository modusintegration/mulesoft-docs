*Anypoint Connectors* facilitate easy integration of your Mule applications with third-party APIs and standard integration protocols. Use connectors within your application's flows to send and receive data using a protocol or specific API. 

== Installing

Anypoint Connectors are bundled with Anypoint Studio, and there is a large library of additional connectors available for download in https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?type=connector[Anypoint Exchange].

Install connectors using Anypoint Exchange. For more information, see link:/anypoint-exchange/ex2-studio[Installing Connectors from Anypoint Exchange].

== Using a Connector

You can design and "test drive" a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in link:/anypoint-exchange/ex2-studio[Installing a Connector from Anypoint Exchange].

Import additional connectors into your Studio instance, or create applications using connectors outside of Studio by adding them as Maven dependencies or including connector libraries with your project.

The following shows the relationship of connectors to other components in the Anypoint Platform:
