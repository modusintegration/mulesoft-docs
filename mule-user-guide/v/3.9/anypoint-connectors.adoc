*Anypoint Connectors* facilitate integration of Mule applications with third-party APIs and standard integration protocols, providing a means to access web services and resources. Use our connectors within your Mule flows to send and receive data over a protocol or using an API.

== Installing

Some Anypoint Connectors are bundled with Anypoint Studio, while others are available to download at link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector[Anypoint Exchange].

For more information, see link:/anypoint-exchange/ex2-studio[Installing Connectors from Anypoint Exchange].

== Using a Connector

You can configure and use a connector in Anypoint Studio following its particular setup guidelines, respecting the functionality and limitations of the API or protocol the connector supports. For a tutorial on basic connector usage, see our link:/getting-started/anypoint-connector[Anypoint Connector quickstart].

Import additional connectors into your Studio instance, or manually create applications using connectors, that is outside of the Studio development environment, by adding them as Maven dependencies or including the required connector libraries with your project.

The following shows the relationship of connectors to other components in the Anypoint Platform:
