= Mule Plugin Format
:keywords: esb, plugin, extend

Mule instances can make use of Mule Plugins, which provide a way to extend the server behavior in an isolated way.

A Mule plugin is a 'zip' file with the following structure:

----
/ \- classes                 // plugin-specific expanded resources (e.g. logging configuration files, properties, etc |- lib                     // plugin-specific jars |- mule-plugin.properties       // custom properties to be added to the registry instance used by the plugin (optional)
----

Mule Plugins must be placed in the folder `<mule_home>/plugins`.

== Plugin Properties

The following properties are currently recognized on the `plugin.properties` file:

* `plugin.className` - full qualified name of the class implementing the plugin
* `plugin.enabled` - indicates if the plugin will be enabled/disable on Mule start
* `plugin.exported` - list of classes, packages and resources visible to Mule Applications
* `loader.overrides` - provides fine-grained control over link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/classloader-control-in-mule[class loading] within a plugin. 

Additionally, a plugin can contain any other property to provide extra plugin configuration.

Here are some things to consider regarding the plugins:

* Each plugin must be packaged as a zip file following the mentioned structure.
* Exploded plugins are currently supported
* Plugins are deployed before any Mule application
