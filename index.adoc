MuleSoft provides the Anypoint Platform to help your organization create integrations and APIs, simplifying the task of connecting multiple data sources.


[[what-is]]
== What is Anypoint Platform?

Anypoint Platform is MuleSoft's *integration application and API suite*. It comprises a unique toolset that enables organizations to create, integrate, model, build, and deploy services, APIs, and Mule applications.

The Anypoint Platform tools are accessed primarily through a browser but also have command line tools and APIs. Through the platform it is possible to control most aspects of integration applications and APIs throughout their entire lifecycle.


== Set up Anypoint Platform

Follow these steps to get an Anypoint Platform account and set up your workstation.

* link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/#/signup?apintent=exchange[Create an Anypoint Platform account].
* Consider the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/hardware-and-software-requirements[MuleSoft hardware and software requirements]
* For development of Mule apps or API design, set up your workstation according to the link:#getting-started-dev[Developer Toolkit].
* To manage and deploy Mule apps, see the link:#getting-started-deploy[Deployment Toolkit].
* To set up platform permissions or monitor deployed assets see the link:#getting-started-manage[Administrator Toolkit].



[[getting-started-dev]]
== Developer Toolkit

After obtaining access to the Anypoint Platform, you are a few steps away from developing integrations with Mule.

. link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/download-and-launch-anypoint-studio[Download and Install Anypoint Studio]. Studio comes with a test Mule server.
. If you are an API developer, ensure you read up on link:/api-manager/[API Manager], accessible from Anypoint Platform, to design, publish and manage APIs.
. Check out templates, connectors and more from link:/anypoint-exchange/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange], where you can find and publish developer resources. You can use Exchange to publish private repositories too.

[NOTE]
If you're working with Mule outside Studio or you have an enterprise license, see how to link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/configuring-maven-to-work-with-mule-esb[Configure Maven] to properly manage the dependencies used by your Mule apps.

[[getting-started-deploy]]
== Deployment Toolkit

For *API deployment*, see link:/api-manager[API Manager], accessible from Anypoint Platform.

For *Mule application deployment*, see link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies[deployment strategies]. This document explains the standard app-to-runtime deployment workflows and tools.


See instructions on how to deploy applications to link:/getting-started/deploy-to-cloudhub[CloudHub] or to link:/getting-started/deploy-to-server[local Mule runtime instances] via the Anypoint Platform.


[[getting-started-manage]]
== Administrator Toolkit

If you are an administrator, provision access to your organization's Anypoint Platform instance through the link:/access-management[Access Management console].

link:/access-management/external-identity[Set up external identities] to manage users and clients using your organization's external federated identity system.

To manage Mule apps and servers, use link:/runtime-manager/[Runtime Manager], the same platform tool used to deploy apps to Mule anywhere.

For APIs, see link:/api-manager[API Manager] and link:/analytics/[Anypoint Analytics].
