== Prerequisites

This tutorial follows the configuration presented in the link:/runtime-manager/vpc-tutorial[VPC Tutorial] so it assumes that you either completed those instructions or created a VPC and configured it similarly to the example. +
It is also recommended for you to be familiar with the link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-architecture[CloudHub architecture].

== Overview

This tutorial walks you through the creation of a *dedicated load balancer* configuring an SSL endpoint for 2-way SSL authentication and mapping lists.

[NOTE]
This feature will eventually be built into the Runtime Manager UI, however currently it’s only available as a service that can be used via the link:/runtime-manager/anypoint-platform-cli[Anypoint Command Line Interface].

Each load balancer can be associated with one or more *SSL endpoints*. Such endpoints are identified by their certificate names. +
Certificates are an important component of your dedicated load balancer. When creating a load balancer, at least one SSL endpoint needs to be configured, meaning that each load balancer needs to have _at least_ one certificate associated to it. +
Understanding how to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-dedicated-load-balancer#managing-certificates[manage certificates], is therefore quite useful when managing dedicated load balancers.

=== Provide a Certificate

Create a custom self-signed certificate for the domain `lb-tutorial-cert`. +

[NOTE]
--
Keep in mind that self-signed certificates are usually set for testing purposes or specific internal usages. You should not use this self-signed certificate in production.

There are plenty of link:http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html[useful tutorials for creating a self-signed certificate].

The following guide shows you how to create a self-signed certificate to use in this example.
--


. In your terminal type, `cd` to your `Documents` folder:
+
[source,Example]
----
> cd /Users/myuser/Documents/
----
+
. Run an openssl request for a new self signed certificate, valid for 10 years:
+
[source,Example]
----
> openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
----
+
. After hitting return, you'll be prompted to complete a few details for your certificate.  +
As a guide, pass the following values:
+
[source,Example,linenums]
----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]: US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]: California
Locality Name (eg, city) []:San Francisco
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:MuleSoft
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []: VPC Tutorial
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []: lb-tutorial-cert
Email Address []:max@mule.com
----

You created a certificate and private key pair, with a common name `lb-tutorial-cert`.

== Create a Load Balancer

A load balancer can be created using the link:/runtime-manager/anypoint-platform-cli#cloudhub-load-balancer-create[load-balancer create] command.

[source,Example]
----
cloudhub load-balancer create // <1>
vpc-tutorial // <2>
lb-tutorial  // <3>
/Users/myuser/Documents/cert.pem /Users/myuser/Documents/key.pem  // <4>
--http on // <5>
--verificationMode on
----
. Pass `vpc-tutorial` as the vpc name in which you want to create the load balancer. +
In order to keep consistency among tutorials, we are using components created in the link:/runtime-manager/vpc-tutorial[VPC tutorial].
. Name the load balancer `lb-tutorial`. +
The load balancer's name must be unique. +
Each load balancer has an internal domain name: `internal-<lb-name>.lb.anypointdns.net` where `<lb-name>` is the name you set here.
. Pass the path to a `.pem` file certificate and its key +
We are using the self-signed certificate created earlier, along with its private key: `cert.pem` and `key.pem`. +
The certificate that you upload to the Load Balancer must be contained in one *_pem_ encoded* and *unencrypted* file. +
Your private key file needs to be *passphraseless*.
. Set the option for the http method to `on`. +
This sets the load balancer to accept all http requests and forwards it to your default SSL endpoint. In this case, the only ssl endpoint configured is `lb-tutorial-cert`
. Set the option for the verificationMode to `on` +
This instructs the SSL endpoint to always verify the certificate

When the operation succeeds, the CLI returns an acknowledgement similar to the following:

[source,Example]
----
Created Load balancer lb-tutorial with Common Name lb-tutorial-cert
----

In order to display the details of the newly created load balancer, use the load-balancer describe command:

[source,Example]
----
cloudhub load-balancer describe lb-tutorial
----

The output gives you the load balancer details:

Now that your VPC has a dedicated load balancer, create a link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-dedicated-load-balancer#url-mapping[URL mapping list] to redirect traffic from your load balancer, to your specific application domain name:

[source,Example]
----
> cloudhub load-balancer mappings add // <1>
lb-tutorial // <2>
0 //<3>
/{app}/ // <4>
{app} // <5>
/
----

. Set `lb-tutorial` as the target for this new mapping rule
. Set the index priority for this mapping rule to `0` +
This rule now has the first priority.
. Set the input URL as `/{app}/` +
This rule uses patterns so that every value passed as `{app}` in the load balancer's domain name: `lb-tutorial.lb.anypointdns.net/{app}` gets mapped to the URL set as the output URL.
. Set the output URL to `{app}` +
So that the domain `lb-tutorial.lb.anypointdns.net/{app}` gets mapped to `{app}.cloudub.io/` using the pattern `{app}` to match your application's name.
. Set the appURI to `/` to redirect to the initial path of your application.

[CAUTION]
--
By default your load balancer listens external requests on https and communicates with your workers internally through http. +
If you configured your Mule application within the VPC to listen on https, make sure you set `upstreamProtocol` to https when creating the mapping list using the link:/runtime-manager/anypoint-platform-cli#cloudhub-load-balancer-mappings-add[load-balancer mappings add] command.

== Update an Existing Load Balancer

It is possible to edit the Whitelists, Mapping Rules and SSL Endpoints from the Anypoint Platform CLI.

Remove the existing configuration using `load-balancer whitelist remove`, `load-balancer mappings remove` and `load-balancer ssl-endpoint remove` respectively and add the new configurations.

=== Update an Existing Load Balancer Using the CloudHub API

Although it is not possible to update certain load balancer values through the Anypoint Platform CLI, you can use the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/anypoint-platform/#/portals/organizations/68ef9520-24e9-4cf2-b2f5-620025690913/apis/8617/versions/85955/pages/107964[Cloudhub API] to programmatically manage and update your load balancer:

. Log in to the CloudHub services passing your credentials to `+https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin+`.
. Use the `organizations/{orgId}/vpcs/{vpcId}/loadbalancers/{lbId}` endpoint to update your load balancer.

[NOTE]
You can use the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/anypoint-platform/#/portals/organizations/68ef9520-24e9-4cf2-b2f5-620025690913/apis/8617/versions/85955/pages/107964[API Reference] to understand how to interact with the API's resources.

For example, to update the `httpmode` of the load balancer, you need to send a `PATCH` request to the `anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/organizations/{orgId}/vpcs/{vpcId}/loadbalancers/{lbId}` endpoint with a JSON payload:

[TIP]
--
You can query your `{orgId}` using the link:/runtime-manager/anypoint-platform-cli#account-business-group-list[account business-group describe] command.

Your `{vpcId}` and `{lbId}` values are listed by running a link:/runtime-manager/anypoint-platform-cli#cloudhub-vpc-describe-json[cloudhub vpc describe-json] and a link:/runtime-manager/anypoint-platform-cli#cloudhub-load-balancer-describe-json[cloudhub load balancer describe-json] command respectively.
