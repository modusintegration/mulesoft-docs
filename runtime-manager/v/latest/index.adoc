Runtime Manager is the Anypoint Platform tool used to deploy and manage all of your Mule applications from one central location, whether your apps are running in the cloud or on-premises.

After you have created a Mule application (for example, see link:/getting-started/build-a-hello-world-application[Hello World Mule application]), you can deploy it anywhere through Runtime Manager. Runtime Manager is designed specifically for handling Mule applications, and deploying them to the available Mule runtime instances in a link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] virtual worker or a Mule server on-premises (server group, cluster, etc.).

[NOTE]
link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] is a complete Platform as a Service that covers all of your server needs out of the box, including Object Store infrastructure, Monitoring, Troubleshooting, Scheduling, etc. Use Runtime Manager to deploy to CloudHub.

[TIP]
====
Note that many pages in the Runtime Manager section are tagged with the following set of icons. They are a general indicator of what deployment strategies are relevant to the content explained on the page.

== Architecture

The cloud-based version of the Anypoint Platform has a Runtime Manager with a console that allows you to manage applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] or elsewhere. With the on-prem platform's Runtime Manager you can deploy anywhere _except_ CloudHub.

For applications deployed to CloudHub (Cloud runtime in diagram below) you can use link:/runtime-manager/insight[Insight] for analytics and monitoring. For applications that you deploy on-premises or to your private cloud servers you can link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-analytics-software[send data to third-party Analytics applications].

Runtime Manager provides a dashboard that indicates the status of every deployed app and monitored server, with a rich set of features you can use to manage and track activity of your running applications.
