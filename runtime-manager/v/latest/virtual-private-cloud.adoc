The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) offering allows you to virtually create a private and isolated network in the cloud to host your link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-architecture#cloudhub-workers[CloudHub workers]. +
You can choose to use this isolated network as it best suites your needs:

* Host your applications in a VPC and take advantage of its link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-dedicated-load-balancer[dedicated load balancer features]
* Configure your own firewall rules to apply to your workers.
* Connect your VPC to your corporate intranet – whether on-premises or in other clouds – via a VPN connection as if they were all part of a single, private network.
* Set your private <<Set up Internal DNS, DNS server>> so the workers hosted in your VPC communicate with your internal network using your private hostnames.

== How VPC Works

As opposed to the default configuration, where all CloudHub workers reside in a link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-architecture#global-worker-clouds[multi-tenant public cloud], balanced by a link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-networking-guide#load-balancing[publicly accessible load balancer], the Virtual Private Cloud grants you a logically private and isolated network dedicated to host your CloudHub worker instances. +

Additionally, you can choose to expose or block your custom ports using your own firewall rules, and even block requests to your apps coming from CloudHub's publicly accessible load balancer so you balance your requests using your own dedicated load balancer. +
Each VPC can host one or more link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-dedicated-load-balancer[dedicated load balancers] with a _DNS A record_ that you can add to your own DNS CNAME record to point to. This way you can configure your VPC's load balancer to handle requests to your own domain. +

Alternatively, you can connect this network to any other network via a secure VPN connection. This allows CloudHub workers to access resources behind your corporate firewall. You can leverage an *IPSec* gateway or *Amazon Web Services (AWS) _Direct Connect_* for VPN connectivity. +
Learn more about each connection alternative in the <<VPC Connectivity Methods>> section below, and how you can configure your own DNS server to redirect to your internal network using your private hostnames.

== Configuring a VPC for Your Account

In order to properly configure a VPC for your account, you need to keep a few considerations in mind.

Defining a proper size for your VPC at the beginning is crucial since once a VPC is created you need to remove all your workers and redeploy them once the change is complete. In order to avoid unnecessary downtime, it is recommended to design your VPC to scale accordingly.
More information can be found in the <<Size Your VPC, VPC size section below>>.

Creating a VPC is the first step. In order for the VPC to be able to host your Workers, it needs to be bound to a business group and a specific CloudHub region, and once it's created, you need to redeploy your applications. +
More information about this can be found in the <<Deploying To Your VPC, deployment section below>>.

You also need to make sure that the firewall rules are configured according to your needs. Check the <<Firewall Rules,firewall rules section below>> for more information.

Once this is defined, you can proceed to create your VPC using:

. The link:/runtime-manager/vpc-tutorial[VPC UI] available in your Runtime Manager section.
. The link:/runtime-manager/anypoint-platform-cli[Anypoint Platform CLI] (Look for the specific `vpc create` command).

If you need to connect other private networks to your CloudHub VPC, follow the steps described in the <<VPC Connectivity Methods, connectivity methods section>>.

== Size Your VPC

When you create a VPC, the range of IP addresses for this network needs to be specified in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block, using link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks[CIDR notation].

In order to calculate the proper sizing for your VPC, you first need to understand that the number of dedicated IP addresses is not the same as the number of workers you have deployed. +
For each worker deployed to CloudHub, the following IP assignation takes place:

* For better fault tolerance the VPC subnet may be divided into up to 4 Availability Zones.
* A few IP addresses are reserved for infrastructure.
* At least two IP addresses per worker to perform at zero-downtime.

Due to this structure, the smallest network subnet block you can assign for your VPC is /24 and the largest /16. +
A /24 (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks[CIDR notation]) subnet has 256 IP addresses. +
Reserving one IP address for the network and one for broadcast you have 254 hosts for your worker, which get divided into 4 availability zones of 62 hosts each. Consider that each worker potentially needs two IP addresses for zero-downtime, that's around 30 IP addresses to assign to your workers.

[NOTE]
--
Updating the size of a VPC once it's created and hosting workers, demands all applications to be undeployed before resizing. +
When planning a VPC size, keep in mind to leave a few spare IP addresses in case you need to host more workers.
--

The safe rule of thumb for deciding the size of your VPC subnet is `10 times the maximum number of expected apps to deploy in the VPC`. +

== Deploying To Your VPC

All VPCs need to be associated with a CloudHub region and to an environment inside one of your CloudHub organization or business group.

When you create a VPC associating it to a region and an environment, every application deployed to that region and that environment is automatically deployed to your VPC.

You can choose to set your VPC as *default* for a specific region, associating the VPC to all environments in that region that are not explicitly associated with other VPC. +
You can have more than one VPC per region.

This means that, for example, having three environments in US-EAST:

. Production
. QA
. Staging

And setting one VPC (`vpc-1`) for _Production_ in *US-EAST* and another VPC (`vpc-2`) as default for *US-EAST* causes for all applications deployed to _Staging_ and _QA_ to be automatically deployed to `vpc-2`.

Applications that were deployed before creating your VPC are not automatically migrated. It is necessary to redeploy the applications so they can be hosted in the VPC.

== VPC Management Permissions

As an organization administrator, you can create a VPC and share it with any business group within your main organization. +
However, once the VPC is inherited by a business group, only the administrator of said business group can operate the VPC (i.e. set worker's firewall rules, assign it as default to an environment within that business group, etc). +

If no business group association is specified, or if your organization does not have any business group, the VPC ownership remains associated with the main organization. +
The organization under which the VPC is created is the *VPC Owner* and this organization's administrator is the only one who can share the VPC.


[NOTE]
--
VPCs can only be shared vertically from the main organization to one of its business groups, or from a business group to one of its link:/access-management/organization#child-business-groups[child business groups]. +
You cannot share a VPC created by a business group with another one of higher hierarchy.
--

[WARNING]
--
A CloudHub organization administrator or a Business Group Owner can create or update an existing VPC (owned or inherited) to make it the default for either the region, the environments or both. +
However, if such association already exists, it's overwritten by the requested VPC.
--

== Firewall Rules

In CloudHub's default configuration, all applications are hosted in a multi-tenant cloud balanced by a publicly accessible load balancer. +
When creating your own isolated network, you can use your own firewall rules to allow specific IP ranges and ports from reaching your workers.

[CAUTION]
--
A Firewall Rule checks inbound connections only to your workers. Not to the VPC or your dedicated load balancer.
--

All traffic to your VPC is blocked, unless it's allowed in a firewall rule.
When creating a VPC, 4 firewall rules are created by default:

* 2 rules to allow inbound connections from your local VPC from ports `8091` and `8092`:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "CIDR Block": "10.111.0.0/24", // (Local VPC)
  "Protocol": "TCP",
  "From port": 8092,
},

{
  "CIDR Block": "10.111.0.0/24", // (Local VPC)
  "Protocol": "TCP",
  "From port": 8091,
},
----
+
These firewall rules allow traffic from the VPC to reach your workers through ports *8091* and *8092* (these are the only ports used by your link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-dedicated-load-balancer[*CloudHub dedicated load balancer*] to proxy all external communications to your workers through).

[TIP]
The `10.111.0.0/24` is an example of a firewall rule whose private address space was set to `10.111.0.0` and sized to have 256 IP addresses. +
These default firewall rules will show the CIDR block that you set for your VPC.

* 2 rules to allow inbound connections from anywhere through ports `8081` and `8082`:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "CIDR Block": "0.0.0.0/0", // (Anywhere)
  "Protocol": "TCP",
  "From port": 8082,
},

{
  "CIDR Block": "0.0.0.0/0", // (Anywhere)
  "Protocol": "TCP",
  "From port": 8081,
}
----
+
These rules allow traffic from any host to reach your workers through ports 8081 and 8082 (these ports are used by *CloudHub's default load balancer* to proxy external requests to your workers).

[TIP]
--
If you don't want your internal workers to be reached by the default load balancer, follow our networking guide to link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-networking-guide#avoiding-public-discoverability-for-applications-on-cloudhub[avoid public discoverability for applications on CloudHub].
--

You can set these rules using the Anypoint Platform CLI's link:/runtime-manager/anypoint-platform-cli#cloudhub-vpc-firewall-rules-add[firewall rule creation command] or use link:/runtime-manager/vpc-tutorial[the UI].

== Resolving Private Domains in Your Internal Network

To resolve domain names within your internal network, you can specify custom private domains by adding the IP address and domain name for your network.

When resolving a domain name in your internal network, consider the following:

* The IP address you configure is for the DNS server of your internal network. It is not the IP address of the service you are connecting to.
* The maximum number of characters of all the domains you configure must not exceed 255 characters. For example, adding the domains `mydomain1.com` and `mydomain2.com` would require 28 characters. Each domain name consumes an additional character because in the DNS hierarchy all domains end with a `.` characer.
* You should avoid entering hostnames to ensure that you do not exceed the 255 character limit.

To Resolve Private Domains in Your Internal Network

. From Anypoint Platform, click Runtime Manager.
. Click VPC.
. Select the row of the VPC you want to configure, then click Manage VPC.
. Select the Internal DNS tab.
. Click Add New IP, then enter the IP address of your internal DNS server.
. Click Add New DNS, then enter the domain name of your internal DNS server.
+
You only need to add the common portion of the domain name, for example: `mulesoft.com`.
. Click Apply Changes

You can configure this feature using the link:/runtime-manager/anypoint-platform-cli#cloudhub-vpc-dns-servers-set[Anypoint Platform CLI's command], or through the link:/runtime-manager/vpc-tutorial#set-dns[VPC UI].

== VPC Connectivity Methods

If you need to connect your VPC to your internal network, or to another Cloud network, select the appropriate connectivity method for your use case. Then, contact your MuleSoft account representative to discuss your specific requirements. 
Once you have selected an option, download link:_attachments/VPC-form-v9.2-template.xlsx[the VPC discovery form] (requires at least MS Excel 2007 with macros enabled), then enter data to communicate the necessary details required for your connectivity method. Once they receive your form and answer any remaining questions, the CloudHub support team securely exchanges keys and supplies instructions on how to configure your router(s).

You can connect a Virtual Private Cloud to a datacenter using any of these methods:

. *Public Internet:* Default connectivity to CloudHub VPC.

. *IPsec tunnel with network-to-network configuration:* Connect a network to a CloudHub VPC with an link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec[IPsec] VPN connection as shown in the diagram below:
+
image:CHVPC02.png[CHVPC02]
+
[NOTE]
IPsec is, in general, the recommended solution for VPC to on-premise connectivity. It provides a standardized, secure way to connect, which integrates well with existing IT infrastructure such as routers/appliances.

. *VPC Peering:* Pair an Amazon VPC directly to a CloudHub VPC.
+
If the services you are connecting to are hosted on AWS, then you can choose to peer your CloudHub VPC and your AWS VPC.
+
The diagram below illustrates connecting a CloudHub VPC and Amazon VPC together directly through VPC peering:
+
image:CHVPC05.png[CHVPC05]

. *CloudHub Direct Connect:* If your network connects to your Amazon VPC using link:https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/[Amazon Direct Connect], you can create a hosted virtual interface to your CloudHub VPC.

The SLA for configuring VPC is 5 business days after link:_attachments/VPC-form-v9.2-template.xlsx[the VPC discovery form] has been completed, returned and approved by support, though it may be completed sooner.
