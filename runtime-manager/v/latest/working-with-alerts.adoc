[TIP]
This document deals with calling the link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-api[CloudHub API]. For instructions on how to perform these same tasks more easily via the Runtime Manager UI, see link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub] and its child pages.

The alerts API allows you to create alerts. All resources or methods that return or accept a type (except where noted) use the application JSON type. As an example, here's a Curl command that would create an alert.

[code]
----
curl -vvvv -XPOST 'https://<Username>:<Password>@anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/alerts?_=<ApplicationID>' -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{"name":"sean","condition":{"application":"sean","event":{"type":"deployment_failure"}},"enabled":true,"email":{"others":["me@mulesoft.com"],"subject":"Deployment Failure","body":"The deployment of your application ${app} has failed. The error was: ${message}\nPlease see your https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/#/console/applications/${app}/logs for more details.\n\nMuleSoft CloudHub | https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/","replyTo":"","accountOwner":false}}' -H "content-type: application/json"
----

[NOTE]
====
To create an alert on an application, you must first obtain that application's ID. You can get that through the following command:

----
curl https://<Username>:<Password>@anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/applications/<ApplicationName>
----
