= Installing the Trial Version of MMC
:keywords: mmc, trial

MuleSoft offers a link:https://www.mulesoft.com/dl/mmc[trial version of the Mule Management Console] for evaluation. The trial version is limited in some functionality and is not appropriate for production deployments. For information about installing the production version of MMC, you can refer instead to link:/mule-management-console/v/3.6/installing-the-production-version-of-mmc[Installing the Production Version of MMC]. 

NOTE: The MMC software contains the 3.7 version number, but is backward compatible with earlier versions of Mule.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you have downloaded the current version of link:https://www.mulesoft.com/dl/mmc[MMC]. For information about installing the production version of MMC, see link:/mule-management-console/v/3.6/installing-the-production-version-of-mmc[Installing the Production Version of MMC].)

See:

* <<macandlinux,Mac and Linux Instructions>>
* <<winin,Windows Instructions>>

== Viewing Command Help

The scripts accept several parameters. For a listing of these parameters, run the desired script from the command line with the `-h` (or `--help`) option. For example, `./startup.sh -h`.

== Download and Start MMC Using Mac or Linux

. Go to link:https://www.mulesoft.com/dl/mmc[MMC] and click *Download*.
. Choose where to save the MMC distribution.
. Extract the file. The MMC distribution file expands to these directories and files:
+
[source,code,linenums]
----
drwxrwxrwx@  3 login_id#   102 release_date mmc-3.7.0
drwxr-xr-x@ 18 login_id#   612 release_date mule-enterprise-3.7.0
-rwxr-xr-x@  1 login_id#  2847 release_date shutdown.bat
-rwxr-xr-x@  1 login_id#  2529 release_date shutdown.sh
-rwxr-xr-x@  1 login_id#  1643 release_date startup.bat
-rwxr-xr-x@  1 login_id#  3965 release_date startup.sh
-rwxr-xr-x@  1 login_id#   940 release_date status.sh
----
+
. To start MMC and Mule ESB, follow these steps:
.. Open a command line or a terminal, and `cd` to the unzipped directory where the scripts reside.
.. Launch the startup script using `./startup.sh`
+
----
$ cd mmc-distribution-mule-console-bundle-3.7.0
./startup.sh
Please enter the desired port for Mule [Default 7777]:
Starting MMC, please wait...
Tomcat started
 ...Messages...
Mule Started
Mule running as PID=5979
Tomcat and MMC running as PID=5671
Finished starting Mule and MMC. Please go to +http://localhost:8585/mmc-3.7.0+
$
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
Always run the scripts from the directory in which they reside. The scripts contain relative paths and do not work properly if you run them from another directory.
+
[TIP]
You can also launch the Unix startup scripts with custom parameters, such as special listening ports. For details, see <<Script Parameters>> below. The Windows script automatically uses port 8585 for Tomcat and 7777 for Mule.
+
. The startup script prompts you for the listening port for Mule. Enter the desired port, or press Enter to accept the default, 7777. On Windows, the startup script does not prompt you for the Mule port, since it always uses the default, 7777.
+
. The startup script launches an embedded Tomcat server (listening on port 8585 by default) and deploys MMC to it. Then, it starts Mule ESB. During startup, your terminal console fills with startup messages. After startup is complete, the script finishes and you regain your terminal prompt. The last few messages indicate successful startup.
+
At this point, Mule and MMC are up and running.
+
. Log in to MMC by opening a Web browser to `+http://localhost:8585/mmc-3.7.0+`.
. You are greeted by the MMC welcome screen, shown below. Log in with username `admin`, password `admin`.

== Stop MMC and Mule Using Mac or Linux

Shuts down any instances of Mule and/or MMC running on Tomcat.

Specify which component(s) to shut down. Valid options are `mule` and `mmc`. If not specified, the script prompts you with the following options:

== Restarting MMC in Mac or Linux

After you enter *./shutdown.sh* at the command line, you can restart MMC by just entering the *./startup.sh* command.

== MMC Logs in Mac or Linux

The messages output by the startup and shutdown scripts are replicated and stored in logs:

* For Tomcat and MMC: `INSTALL_DIR/mmc-distribution-mule-console-bundle-3.7.0/mmc-3.7.0/apache-tomcat-7.0.52/logs`

== Download and Start MMC Using Windows

[IMPORTANT]
Always run the scripts from the directory in which they reside. The scripts contain relative paths and do not work properly if you run them from another directory.

[NOTE]
The `status` script is not available for Windows.

The startup.bat script launches an instance of Mule Enterprise and an instance of MMC inside a Tomcat app server. This script has no options other than the `-h` or `--help` option.

By default, the startup script uses port 7777 for Mule and 8585 for Tomcat. Before launching, the script checks to see that these ports are not in use. If the ports are being used, the script exits with an error message.

NOTE: Either JAVA_HOME or JRE_HOME must be set for the startup script to run successfully.

To start MMC in Windows:

. Download and unzip the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/dl/mmc[trial version of the Mule Management Console].
. Locate the command prompt, right click the command prompt, and click *Run as administrator*.
. Windows prompts to be sure you want to proceed.
. Change directory to the folder containing your unzipped MMC software and change directory to the `mmc-distribution-mule-console-bundle-3.7.0` folder.

== Restarting MMC in Windows

. Before starting, dismiss all command prompt windows and any Tomcat windows that are present.
. Open a new command prompt window not as administrator, change directory to the MMC distribution directory and use the *startup.bat* command to restart MMC.
. In the 'User Account Control' window, click *Yes* to let the program make changes to this computer.
. If the command fails because port 8585 is in use, change directory to the distribution directory and re-enter the *shutdown.bat* command.
. Open a new command prompt window, change directory to the distribution directory, and use *startup.bat* command to restart MMC. If needed, repeat steps 2 to 4 until startup.bat is successful.

== MMC Logs in Windows

The messages output by the startup and shutdown scripts are replicated and stored in logs:

* For Tomcat and MMC: `INSTALL_DIR\mmc-distribution-mule-console-bundle-3.7.0\mmc-3.7.0\apache-tomcat-7.0.52\logs`
* For Mule ESB: `INSTALL_DIR\mmc-distribution-mule-console-bundle-3.7.0\mule-enterprise-3.7.0\logs\mule_ee.log`
