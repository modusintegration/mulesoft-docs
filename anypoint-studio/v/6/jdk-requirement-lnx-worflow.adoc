= Workflow: Configuring Java JDK for Studio (Linux and Unix)

After downloading the JDK from Oracle's site and following the installation instructions, you need to make sure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is pointing to your JDK installation:

. Edit the startup file (~/.bashrc).
. Modify PATH variable
+
[source,bash,linenums]
----
PATH=/usr/local/jdk1.8.0/bin:$PATH
export PATH
----
. Save and close the file.
. Load the startup file.
+
[source,bash,linenums]
----
> . /.profile
----
. Verify that you configured your installation correctly
+
[source,bash,linenums]
----
> java -version
----
+
This should print the version of the java tool. If the version is old or you get the error "java: Command not found", then the JDK is not properly installed.

Under certain circumstances, if you had a JRE installation previous to installing the JDK, your default VM could still be configured as the JRE. +
You can configure Anypoint Studio to point to your JDK installation as the default VM, by following the "Configure Studio's Default VM on Windows" task. +
If after following those steps, Anypoint Studio still does not recognize your JDK installation, consider uninstalling your JRE.
