= Consuming an API Reference
:keywords: api, portal, sla, oauth, developer portal, anypoint platform developer portal

You can make information about APIs you develop in Anypoint Platform publicly available for applications that want to consume the API. You can publish APIs on your organization's developer portal or create your own portal for a particular API. You can limit access to certain users.

== Accessing a Developer Portal

You can access your organization's developer portal by using the name of your organization in the following URL:

`+http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/\{yourorgdomain}/#/portals+`

From the API Administration page, you can also access your organization's developer portal using the hamburger menu on the right.

API access management provides the Portals Viewer role for accessing a developer portal or an API portal. API portals listed on the developer portal that are public or to which you have been granted Portals Viewer access are visible.

=== Searching Developer Portals

You can browse the portals alphabetically, or search for APIs according to name, version, or tags.

=== Accessing the Anypoint Platform Developer Portal

The Anypoint Platform developer portal is an example of a public developer portal. From this portal you can access Anypoint Platform APIs to automate Anypoint Platform activities.

== Accessing API Portals

To access the portal for an API from a developer portal that lists APIs, click the name or version number of the API.

An API Owner determines the content of their API portal. Typically, you see documentation for the API and links to resources, such as an API Console. If the API you are browsing is implemented with RAML, you can use the API Console to explore the different calls and responses.

If you are browsing an API portal for an API that already has an API URL set up by its API Owners, you see Request API Access at the top of the API. If the API is public, requesting API access has no effect. Just use the API; otherwise, click Request API Access and fill in the dialog. If you have previously registered an application for any API in the organization's developer portal, that application appears in your drop-down menu. If you are registering an API for the first time, click New Application.

== Registering an Application 

When you request access to an Anypoint Platform API, API Manager prompts you to provide key information about your application: Name, Description, Application URL, and Redirect URI. If your organization is signed up to use PingFederate or OpenAM for identity management, you are also prompted to select an OAuth Grant Type. Your contact information is requested in the event the API owner needs to migrate your application to a new version of the API, for example. If the API has SLA tiers, select one of them. Click Request Access. If the API does not define SLA tiers, or if the SLA tier you select is configured for automatic approval, the "Your API access request has been approved" message displays. If the access request requires manual approval, wait for the API owner to grant your request.

Provide the information and click Submit.

If needed, you can manually reset your client secret on the Application Details page.  

== Removing an Application

If you want to delete an application that you gave access to your API, from the API Administration page in API Manager, locate the API. Click Public Portal. Click Developer portal (upper left corner). In My Applications, select the name of the application to delete. Click Delete (upper right corner).

This will also delete any granted access to that application from API Manager portal.

== Accessing Your Application Client ID and Client Secret

After you have registered an application, you can access application information from the My Applications tab in the organization's developer portal. Log in to see your application information, which is only visible to you. My Applications provides a unique client ID and client secret for your application, which you need to pass your API calls for APIs that are protected with policies. Included in My Applications is a list of the APIs your application is currently registered to use.

To edit the details of your application, click the pencil icon next to your application name.

== Changing SLA Tiers

The following options describe the various ways that you and/or an API Owner can change the SLA tier that your application is contracted to use.

* If you requested access to a tier and have not yet been approved for that tier, you can reapply for access to a different tier and your request for access is automatically updated to the new tier.
* If you have been approved for a tier, you can reapply for access to a different tier. If the new tier requires manual approval, you need to wait for the API Owner to change your tier per your request.
* If you were previously approved for an SLA tier and your access to that tier was revoked, you can reapply for access to a tier. The API Owner can then restore your access and adjust the tier.
* If you were approved for an SLA tier and that tier is deprecated by the API Owner, you can apply for access to a non-deprecated tier. The API Owner can then change your tier per your request.
* The API Owner can also change your tier without a change request from you.

== Accessing APIs Protected OAuth Token Enforcement

When you work in an organization that uses PingFederate or OpenAM for identity management, you need to supply additional information to develop your application. Register your application on Anypoint Platform to obtain a client ID and client secret and register them in the federated orgnaization, and work with your organization administrator to get necessary OAuth information.

When you register applications for access to APIs in a federated organization, you need to provide an OAuth Grant Type, Application URL, and OAuth 2.0 Redirect URI.
