= To Classify an API

An unclassified environment is the target environment where all APIs are placed after you upgrade to the API Manager 2.x. APIs you upgrade from the API Manager 1.x to API Manager 2.x reside in the unclassified environment. Also, any API is classified that you didn't associate with an environment prior to moving to API Manager 2.x. You need to classify any unclassified APIs to govern or otherwise manage the APIs.

If the API is not running, follow the single-step classification process in this procedure. If the API is running, follow the two-step classification process.

== Single-step Classification

. In API Manager, click the environment control, labeled SANDBOX, in this example:
+

+
If you do not see a suitable environment for classification of the API, create one in Access Management.
. In Switch Environment, select Unclassified.
+

+
. Click Switch.
+
A list of unclassified APIs appears.
+

+
. Click Classify.
. In Target Environment, select the environment for the API from the list of environments available to you. For example, select Test.
. In Instance Label, optionally type a unique instance name. For example, type abc-api-1
+
In environments, APIs can have more than a single instance. Therefore, an instance name is required to uniquely identify it.

== Two-step Classification

The classification process involves the following steps when the API is running:

* Updating the server where the API or API proxy is running.
* Classifying the API into the suggested environment.

=== To Update the Server

The procedure to update the server depends on how you deployed the API. Follow instructions below for your deployment type. 

==== Managed by Proxy Deployed through API Manager

*Deployed in CloudHub*

. In API Manager, click the API to classify.
. In Configure Endpoint, click Redeploy Proxy.
. Choose a Runtime version.
. Click Redeploy Proxy.

*Deployed in a Standalone Runtime*

To deploy a new server with Runtime Agent 1.9.x or later:

. In API Manager, click the API to classify.
. In Configure Endpoint, click Deploy Proxy.
. Select the Runtime with Runtime Agent 1.9.x or later.
. Click Redeploy Proxy.

To update an existing server:

. SSH into the standalone Runtime server.
. Download Runtime Agent 1.9.x.
. Update the gateway Runtime agent.
. Restart gateway.

==== Managed by a Basic Endpoint or Proxy Deployed through Runtime Manager

Anypoint Platform assigns the unique and immutable Organization ID and Environment IDs at organization and environment creation times.

*Deployed in CloudHub*

. Get the environment client Id and secret:
+
* Go to Access Manager.
* Click  Environments.
* Click the environment name that you want to use.
* Copy the Client Id and Client Secret.
. Update the application in CloudHub:
+
* Go to the proxy application in Runtime Manager.
* Click Settings > Properties.
* Change the values of the following properties to the values from the Environment:
+
** Anypoint.platform.client_id
** Anypoint.platform.client_secret
** Click Apply changes.

*Deployed in standalone Mule Runtime*

. SSH into the standalone Runtime server where the application is deployed.
. Download Runtime Agent 1.9.x.
. Update Runtime Agent.
. Restart Mule Runtime.

==== Other Deployments

Perform these steps to prepare Mule Runtime to use API environments without updating the agent or registering the server with Runtime Manager.

. Get the environment client Id and secret:
+
* Go to Access Manager.
* Click  Environments.
* Click the environment name that you want to use.
* Copy the Client Id and Client Secret.

*Updating an application in CloudHub*

. Go to the proxy application in Runtime Manager.
. Click Settings > Properties.
. Change the values of the following properties to the values from the Environment:
+
* anypoint.platform.client_id
* anypoint.platform.client_secret

*Updating standalone Runtimes*

. SSH into the Runtime server that you want to update.
. Edit the <mule_home>/<conf>/wrapper.conf file.
. Change the values of the following properties to the values from the Environment:
+
* anypoint.platform.client_id
* anypoint.platform.client_secret
. Restart Mule Runtime.

=== To Complete API Classification

After updating the server, when the application is up and running again, a classification suggestion appears in the API list. Click the suggestion and follow the instructions.
