= About Crowd Release Availability and Changes

This topic outlines the API lifecycle and describes the differences between the Crowd release and previous versions of Anypoint Platform. Anypoint Platform enables you to design, implement, and deploy Mule applications based on an API. To accomplish this, Anypoint Platform contains product components that assist you in each stage of the API lifecycle.

The Crowd release introduces additional product components and features that enhance the API lifecycle. See <<which-version>> to determine if you can use these new tools and features.

See <<lifecycle-comparison>> for a general overview of the API Lifecycle and comparison of feature differences between the Crowd release and previous versions.


[[which-version]]
== Which Version of the API Lifecycle Can I Use?


* *New Anypoint Platform accounts created after July 29*: If you create a new trial account, you will see all the elements of the Crowd release including the API designer within Design Center.
* *Anypoint Platform accounts (Customer, trial, and partner organizations) created before
July 29*: For all platform accounts created before Jul 29 will continue to use current API Designer within API Manager. We will be migrating all of these accounts to new API designer as part of Crowd Phase 2 release. Note that the new API designer will be enabled only after your APIs are migrated. Additional migration information will be available during the upcoming release.



If your platform account is created after July 29 and you don’t see the option to Create API Specification or Create API Fragment option in Design Center, please check to ensure that the user has the permission to be a Design Center Developer. If you still can’t see the options of Create ‘API Specification’ or Create ‘API Fragment’ after following this step, please contact MuleSoft support.

== API Lifecycle Release Comparison

The Crowd release of Anypoint Platform introduces changes to the API lifecycle. These changes include features and product components that enhance and improve the API lifecycle, including:

* A new web-based tool, Anypoint Design Center, that enables you to create API definitions and Mule flows.
* Enhancements to Exchange that enhance collaboration and discovery.
* Further integration of Anypoint Platform tools.

The following table lists each stage of the API lifecycle and compares the tools introduced in the Crowd release with those used in the previous release:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| |Design (RAML) | Engage | Implement | Deploy | Manage (Policies)
| Previous Releases | API Manager | Exchange 1.0  / API Manager | Studio  | Runtime Manager | API Manager
| Crowd Release | Design Center | Design Center / Exchange 2.0 | Design Center/ Studio | Runtime Manager | API Manager
|===

The following sections provide information about the changes introduced in each stage of the API lifecycle:

=== Design (RAML)

The first phase in the API lifecycle is to define the specification for your API using RAML. The Crowd release introduces Anypoint Design Center, a web-based editor that enables you to define API specifications and fragments or create functional Mule applications.

Using Design Center, you can author, simulate, and validate an API. At any stage of the API design process, you can publish your API to Exchange 2.0 to obtain feedback and collaborate with other API designers.

In previous versions, APIs were created and edited using Anypoint API Manager.

=== Engage

After creating an initial API specification during Design phase, you can obtain feedback and collaborate with other API designers by publishing a specification to Exchange. Using Design Center and Exchange 2.0, you can continue the iterative process of creating an API by collaborating and obtaining feedback.

Exchange 2.0 also provides enhanced discoverabilitiy by making it easier for collaborators and consumers to find your APIs. Exchange provides a central repository for sharing and discovering your organization’s APIs. In Exchange, you can also publish best practices, templates, examples, and other types of information related to your API.

In previous versions, collaboration and feedback were accomplished using Exchange and API Manager.

=== Implement

After the Design and Engage stages of the API lifecycle, you can implement the API specification by creating a functioning Mule application. Anypoint Platform provides two different environments for implementing Mule applications:

* Anypoint Design Center: provides web-based editor that is targeted to contributors with diverse skill sets (line-of-business, application developers).
* Anypoint Platform Studio:  provides an IDE that is fully integrated within the new API lifecycle. You can export a project from Design Center and load it in Studio.

Exchange works directly with Anypoint Platform and Anypoint Studio to provide a single point of access for information and assets.

=== Deploy

After creating and testing a functioning Mule application during the Implementation phase, you can deploy your application to Mule runtime using Anypoint Runtime Manager.

=== Manage

After deploying your Mule application, you can also define policies that define how your API are accessed and who has access to it. You can define policies using Anypoint API Manager. You can deploy them from Anypoint Runtime Manager.

You can also manage and monitor a running application using Anypoint Runtime Manager.
