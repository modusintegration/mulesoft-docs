= APIkit for SOAP 1.0.2 Release Notes

This version of APIkit for SOAP includes a fix to the runtime. In Studio, if a SOAP action is not defined, an attempt to generate flows based on a WSDL (scaffold a WSDL) now throws an error message: `SOAP action is required`. The scaffolding process is aborted. No flows are generated.

== Compatibility

* Mule Runtime 3.7.3 and 3.8.x
* Anypoint Studio 6.2.3+
* Java Parser RAML 1.0 v1.0.9

== Fixed in This Release

APIKITSOAP-62 The SOAP router should log error message when the SOAP action is undefined.
