The Anypoint(TM) Connector for Salesforce Composite provides you a way to integrate with Salesforce Composite API link:https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_composite.htm[Salesforce Composite API]. The connector exposes convenient methods for preparing sub-requests, execute them in one batch and parse the results. It provides DataSense on both preparation of sub-requests and parsing response of their execution.

* *INVALID_SESSION_ID not triggering reconnection strategy:* Previously, when the Invalid Session Id exception occurred the reconnection strategy did not kick in as expected. Now, when such an exception occurs the reconnection strategy is successfully started.
* *Propagate errors from Salesforce Composite connector*: In previous versions, the exception handling for the Salesforce specific errors was hidden by the connector and no details about the error encountered was visible to the user. Now, error details such as status code and exception message are forwarded to the end user.

=== Version 1.0.1 Known Issues

* Support for TLS1.0 is discontinued in Salesforce.
* If by default the application tries to use TLS1.0, then, when running it, the following VM argument should be added: -Dhttp.protocols=TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2
This will ensure the fact that TLS1.1 or TLS1.2 will be used for the communication with Salesforce.
