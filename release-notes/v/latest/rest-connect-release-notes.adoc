REST Connect quickly converts a RAML 1.0 API specification to a connector, which you can use in a Mule Application in the Design Center feature of Anypoint Platform.

== Version 1.1.0 - October 2, 2017

Version 1.1.0 supports creating Mule 3 connectors. When an API specification publishes to Exchange, REST Connect generates two connectors: one for Mule 4 and the other for Mule 3.

=== Version 1.1.0 - Fixes

REST Connect v1.1.0 now generates a connector properly whether a description is present or not. In REST Connect v1.0.0, if a description was not provided, REST Connector was unable to generate a connector properly.

== Version 1.0.0 - July 28, 2017

Version 1.0.0 provides the following features:

* Transforms a RAML 1.0 specification into a connector in Design Center.
* Supports for unauthorized requests, basic authentication, and OAuth2 (Client Credentials).
* Support for query parameters, URI parameters and headers as input attributes.
* Support for metadata defined as RAML datatypes, XML schemas or JSON schemas.
