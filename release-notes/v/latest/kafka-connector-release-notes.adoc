|Mule Runtime | Mule Runtime Enterprise Edition 3.7.0 and newer
|Apache Kafka | 0.10.2.0
|===


=== Version 2.0.1 - Fixed in this Release

* *Too many open files open Error*. In  previous versions when using an external property location for producer properties a "Too many files open" error showed up as soon if the same number of requests were sent as the file limit on the machine. Now, it works as expected.
* *Kafka client exceptions lost by Kafka consumer operation*. In previous versions kafka client exceptions were lost and so the errors were not being reported back to the connector, not reporting a _not consumed message_. Now the connector reports the error as expected.
* *Unhandled exceptions when using Kafka Connector in a synchronous flow*. When using the connector in synchornous flow , exceptions were not handled and the flow didn't go into the _Exception Strategy_. Now the exceptions are handled and the flow goes to the _Exception Strategy_ as expected.
