|===

=== Version 3.1.1 Features

None.

=== Version 3.1.1 Fixes

* *Invalid ConnectionTimeout and ReadTimeout configuration parameters:* Previously, when the ConnectionTimeout or the
ReadTimeout fields were set, they didn't affect the client and had no effect whatsoever. This led to having
SocketTimeoutExceptions when running particularly long operations or not having them when the expected timeout was set
to be short. Now they are working correctly and the timeouts happen when expected.

=== Version 3.1.1 Known Issues

* None.
