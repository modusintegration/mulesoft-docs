== Community Edition Migration to Mule 3.8.0

When migrating to Mule 3.8.0, follow the implicit and explicit guidelines related to these issues:

[%header,cols="25a,75a"]
|===
|Issue |Description
| MULE-12245 |	Old Xalan and Xerces implementations were removed in favor of the newer versions included in Java. Only minor incompatibilities could result such as ordering changes of some XML attributes.
| MULE-12017 |	log4j was updated from 2.5 to 2.8.2 and slf4j from 1.7.7 to 1.7.24. There is a minor incompatibility with code using logger.error(null, "message", e), in which case the first null argument should be omitted.
| MULE-11948 |	Saxon was upgraded from 9.6.0-7 to 9.6.0-10
| MULE-9931 |	"Transaction log files size are now restricted by size, using a default size of 500 mb. The configured size is just an approximated value which may be exceeded based on the size of the record store by the transaction. This is configurable using the attribute queueTransactionFilesSize of the <configuration> element. +
The size restriction applies to the set of transaction log files for local transactions and XA transactions independently meaning that if both types of transactions are used for queue the set of tx files will use up to 1 gb."
| MULE-10100 |	MULE-10100: Processing after a synchronous until successful resulting in a VoidMuleEvent will now continue with the original event.
| MULE-10306 |	MULE-10306: XML entity expansion in XML transformers is now disabled by default because it allows DoS attacks. To restore previous behaviour use the expandInternalEntities="true" attribute.
| MULE-10686 |	MULE-10686: XML entity expansion in Jersey is now disabled by default because it allows DoS attacks. To restore previous behaviour use the mule.xml.expandInternalEntities=true property.
| MULE-10979 |	MULE-10979: The default response timeout and default transaction timeout can't be configured using system properties on the command line or in the wrapper.conf file anymore. In replacement, use the configuration element. For example: <configuration defaultResponseTimeout="20000"   defaultTransactionTimeout="40000"/>.
| MULE-11118 |	MULE-11118: The HTTP listener now replies with status code 503 when the thread pool is exhausted (and poolExhaustedAction="ABORT") instead of closing the socket.
| MULE-11825 |	MULE-11825: In a DB template query, to set a DB param with the null value, you can use the "NULL" literal value. For example: <db:in-param name="name" defaultValue="NULL"/>
| MULE-12385 |	MULE-12385: Reconnection Strategies can only be defined in connector components or globally (using <configuration> element). In mule 3.x, defining reconnection strategies was being supported by the XSD, but ignored by Runtime. Now, the XSD was changed to not allow to use this invalid configuration.
| MULE-12612 |	MULE-12612: As FTP reconnection is at operation level, FTP connector does not support asynchronous reconnection strategies because it only makes sense if reconnection takes place during the start phase of the connector lifecycle. In case you use this kind of reconnection, please change them as follows: <reconnect blocking="true"/> inside FTP Connector, or just remove the blocking attribute.
|	MULE-13164 | Inconsistent null return from one-way VM inbound endpoint. From Mule 3.9 one-way inbound VM endpoints will now consistently return null to Flow using a request-response outbound endpoint or Mule Client using send(). (In previous versions a successful response led to null return yet an error resulted in a message being returned.)
|	MULE-11246 | The secretAliasId parameter isn't mandatory anymore. If not given, Mule will take the secretAliasId from the message to decrypt. Additionally, from 3.9.x the secretAliasId must be an hexadecimal value.
|	MULE-11161 | The default PGP Encryption algorithm has been changed from CAST5 to AES 256.|
