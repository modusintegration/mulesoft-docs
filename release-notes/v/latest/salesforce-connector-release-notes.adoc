=== Version 8.3.1 - Fixed in this Release

* *Failure to refresh metadata*: In the previous version _Refresh Metadata_ failed when references (__r) were used in a *SELECT* statement. Currently statements like: `SELECT a.OtherObject_r.CustomFieldc FROM MyCustomObject_c a' should work.

* *Salesforce topic subscription failure with API v37 v38 and v39*: In previous version/s, in long-running salesforce applications subscribed to a topic it throwed a _org.cometd.3_0_10.shade.common.TransportException: {httpCode=404}_. Currently, after a proper configuration, topic subscription shouldn't fail after a long-running.

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule Enterprise Edition 3.5.2 and newer
|Anypoint Studio|Only works with Studio 5.4.0 and newer
|Salesforce|v37.0, v38.0
|===

=== Version 8.2.1 - Fixed in this Release

* In the previous version 8.2.0, the name of the parameter given to operations that were expecting an object of type BatchInfo as input was changed from `batch-info` to `batch-to-retrieve`, which affected  existing apps using those operations. In version 8.2.1 `batch-to-retrieve` has been changed back to `batch-info` and `batch-to-retrieve` has been removed.

Example of operation using `batch-to-retrieve`:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sfdc:batch-info config-ref="Salesforce__Basic_Authentication" doc:name="Salesforce">
    <sfdc:batch-to-retrieve ref="#[payload]"/>
</sfdc:batch-info>
----

In version 8.2.1, this operation has been changed back to how it was in the past:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<sfdc:batch-info config-ref="Salesforce__Basic_Authentication" doc:name="Salesforce">
    <sfdc:batch-info ref="#[payload]"/>
</sfdc:batch-info>

* Added support for providing custom headers in the *Create Job* operation that provides behavior similar to "PK Chunking", see: link:https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/async_api_headers_enable_pk_chunking.htm[PK Chunking Header].
* Added support for providing custom headers on *Query Result Stream* that lets you set headers on request. This can be useful if you want, for example, to receive data in GZIP format by adding "Accept-Encoding=GZIP" as a header.
* Added support for providing custom headers on *Batch Result Stream* that lets you set headers on request. This can be useful if you want, for example, to receive data in GZIP format by adding "Accept-Encoding=GZIP" as a header.

=== Version 8.2.0 - Fixed in this Release

* Added enhancements to the Streaming API. The connector stores the replay ID for the last processed event. The user now has the possibility to replay all unprocessed events within the 24 hour time-frame provided by Salesforce. The replay ID can now be specified as a MEL expression.
* Added support for Batch Info List bulk API call. See: link:https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.202.0.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/asynch_api_batches_get_info_all.htm[Get Information for All Batches in a Job]

* From now on, exception is thrown instead of hanging when a header from response is not recognized. (For example, for this use case: when a proxy is altering response from Salesforce.)
* Proxy configuration was not taken in consideration by streaming inbound endpoints, fixed it.
* When domain name was containing word "services" (for example, `+https://services--dev.salesforce.com/services/c/38.0+`) the computation of service endpoint to which upcoming requests are send was wrong, so it was fixed.

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|Mule Runtime|Mule Enterprise Edition 3.5.2 and newer
|Anypoint Studio|Only works with Studio 5.4.0 and newer
|Salesforce|v32.0 to v34.0
|===

This is a *major version* change, hence the connector *might break backward compatibility* for some existing flows.
It uses DevKit 3.7 and its new features (like multi-level Datasense for invokeApexSoapMethod and invokeApexRestMethod) and dates are no longer passed as String, but as Dates and Calendars. To see how the new metadata key ids are formed for invokeApexSoapMethod and invokeApexRestMethod please read below.

=== Version 7.0.0 Features

* The connector now supports versions 32.0 to 34.0 of the Salesforce API.
* *get-session-id*
** Added an extra optional input parameter to this operation, that forces the session validation.
* *describe-global* and *describe-sobject*
** Added an extra optional parameter to these operations in order to add Salesforce SOAP headers on the requests.
* *invoke-apex-rest-method*
** Added support for Custom Types and Apex Custom Types
** Added multilevel Datasense (the user has to choose the Apex Class first and then in a following parameter, the user must choose a Method Name from the ones available for that class)
** The resulting metadata key id will have the following format:
'apexClassName||apexMethodName\^resourceUrl^httpMethod\^outputType^inputParameters'
where
*** apexClassName is the value chosen by the user for the "Apex Class" parameter under the General section of the connector tab;
*** apexMethodName is the value chosen by the user for the "Method Name" parameter under this General section;
*** resourceUrl is the value of urlMapping attribute from the '@RestResource' annotation of the apex class;
*** httpMethod is the http method annotation of the Apex Rest resource (e.g. @HttpGet, @HttpPost) without the '@' symbol;
*** outputType is the method output type (e.g. 'List<Account>');
*** inputParameters is a comma separated list of input parameters (their name and their type - e.g. 'account=Account, someParameter=String');
*** '||' is a separator used between the class name and the method name;
*** '^' is a separator for the method details.
* *invoke-apex-soap-method*
** Added multilevel Datasense (the user has to choose the Apex Class first and then in a following parameter, the user must choose a Method Name from the ones available for that class)
** The resulting metadata key ID will have the following format: 'apexClassName||apexMethodName' where:
*** apexClassName is the value chosen by the user for the "Apex Class" parameter under the General section of the connector tab;
*** apexMethodName is the value chosen by the user for the "Method Name" parameter under this General section;
*** '||' is a separator used between the class name and the method name.
* Changed *Test Connection* to *Validate Configuration* and added a validation for Apex Classes and Proxy configurations if these are set in the connector configuration.
* *merge*
** This is a new operation to support merging of accounts.
* *reset-password*
** This is a new operation to offer support to users wanting to reset their password through the connector.
* Added the ability to use external IDs in metadata (DataMapper or DataWeave).
* Added support for List<String> for fieldsToNull.

=== Version 7.0.0 Fixed in this Release

* Changed the creation of the URLs used for Apex SOAP and Apex REST requests, in order to support reverse proxies.
* Modified some Java documentation that incorrectly appeared as explanations in Studio elements like configurations.
* Corrected the parsing of dates from Apex REST invocation responses.
* Added validation for the existence of IDs when using the *retrieve* operation, to avoid possible exception thrown when it is called.
* Dates are now returned as Calendars rather than Strings, for easier use (comparison or alteration).
* Fixed issue with Apex REST URL not supporting certain characters like period ('.').
* Improved overall performance for Apex REST invocation by avoiding the download and parsing of the Apex REST class at every invocation; instead we are relying on the information obtained during Datasense and data stored in the metadata key id related to the method to be invoked.
//TODO: confirm wording in above bullet point was meant to be "settings" not "set", which did not make sense.
* Removed default proxy port from the configuration as it is confusing.
* Handle the Salesforce Address type as an object in metadata rather than a String, as before.

=== Version 7.0.0 Known Issues

* This version of the connector breaks backward compatibility:
** the way some metadata key ids are created was changed due to some performance enhancements (invokeApexSoapMethod and invokeApexRestMethod are affected by this).
** the way the connector works with Dates has been changed: dates are no longer expected/returned as Strings; they are used as Dates or Calendars, for easier use (comparison and calculations), depending on their types.
* Salesforce has a know issue with creating correct WSDLs for the Apex SOAP classes created under version 34.0 and 35.0 of the API. As a workaround Salesforce suggested that the Apex SOAP classes should be created under version 32.0 to be able to use them.
* For versions v28.0, v29.0 of the Salesforce API use version v5.4.12 of the connector.


== Salesforce Connector 6.2.3 - July 23, 2015

=== Version 6.2.3 Fixed in This Release

* Fixed an error where session expiration would not be handled correctly even with a reconnection strategy set, in operations that returned a SalesforcePagingDelegate (query, queryall).

== Salesforce Connector 6.2.2 - July 22, 2015

=== Version 6.2.2 Fixed in This Release

* A bug that logged warning messages as errors once a session expired even if you had reconnection on has been fixed.
* Support for session concurrency in multi-threaded applications has now been improved.
