= Object Store
:keywords: object, store, object store

Object Store v2 lets you share data and states across batch processes, Mule components, and multiple distributed applications. You can also use object store as a distributed object store for advanced use cases such as API caching and API rate limiting.

*Note:* To use Object Store v2, you must have an entitlement for this product. Contact your MuleSoft Sales rep for more information.

== Components

Anypoint Object Store consists of these components:

* *link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/object-store-connector[Object Store Connector]* - 
Use with Anypoint Studio to construct flows to write to and read from the 
object store. You can install the Object Store connector using Anypoint
Exchange from within Anypoint Studio. After installed, search Studio 
for "objectstore". The Object Store connector works with both 
Object Store version 1 and version 2. Use Studio to create an application 
that you deploy to Runtime Manager where the application runs and serves 
requests to read to and write from the object store.

* *link:/object-store/osv2-apis[REST API]* - Lets you create and delete objects, set TTL (time to live) for objects, and set usage limits.

* *Runtime Manager* > *Object Store* user interface - When you enable object store, the Runtime Manager > Application Data setting changes its label to Object Store. From the object store interface, you can administer objects and their values in the object store. The interface also lets you delete object store objects.

== To Use Object Store Connector in an Application

Anypoint Studio is used to assemble the elements of your application and to test run it to ensure the application works. After you ensure your application works, you can use Studio to upload your application
to the Anypoint Platform cloud environment where you can deploy the application. To send content
to the object store, you can use a program such as Postman.

*Note:* If you are starting with Anypoint Studio, refer to link:/object-store/osv2-tutorial#create-an-object-store-application-in-anypoint-studio[Create an Object Store Application in Anypoint Studio].

. In Anypoint Studio, click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Create a simple flow such as the following:
+
[%headers,cols="25s,75a"]
|===
|Building Block |*Parameters*
|HTTP connector |Host = `All interfaces [0.0.0.0] (Default)` +
Port = `8081` +
Path = `/store` +
Allowed Methods = `POST`
|Object to String |No settings (use defaults)
|JSON to Object | Return Class = `java.util.Map`
|Object Store +
(`objectstore`) connector |Key = `&#x0023;[payload.key]` +
Value Reference = `&#x0023;[payload.value]`
|Set Payload |Settings = `KEY: &#x0023;[payload.key] AND VALUE: &#x0023;[payload.value] WERE SAVED OK`
|===
+
When done, the flow appears as:
+
image:osv2-studio-flow.png[osv2-studio-flow]
+
. Save the application. Test run the application so you know it works. Right-click the canvas and click *Run project <name>*. If the application starts successfully, you can stop it. Right-click the canvas and click *Stop project <name>*.
. Right-click your application’s name in Anypoint Studio’s Package Explorer and click *Anypoint Platform* > *Deploy to Cloud*.
. At the User login window, specify your Anypoint Platform username and password, and click *Sign in*. If you don’t have an Anypoint Platform login, click *Sign up*.
. In Runtime Manager:

** Give the application a name. Each name is unique and becomes the URL under which your application
is stored in Runtime Manager. The URL is in the form `<application_name>.cloudhub.io`. Ensure the application name gets a green checkmark for proper naming and being unique.
** Set the *Runtime version* to a version with `OBJECT-STORE` in the runtime name.
** Click the *Use Object Store v2* checkbox.

+
. After configuring your application, click *Deploy Application*.
. Runtime Manager prompts you to ensure you want to make this choice.
. Start your application.

When you choose a *Runtime Version* containing `OBJECT-STORE` in the version name, the *Application Data* label in the Runtime Manager navigation bar on the left side of the screen changes to *Object Store*.


== To Send Data to the Object Store

From a command line prompt, use a utility to send JSON data to your Mule application. This can be a command such as
curl, link:https://www.getpostman.com/apps[Postman], or a browser extension.

If you use Windows, you can get an add-on curl command from:

* *Postman* - Provides downloads for both link:https://www.getpostman.com/apps[64-bit and 32-bit Windows].
* *curl.haxx.se* for link:https://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/?type=bin&os=Win64[64-bit Windows] or link:https://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/?type=bin&os=Win32[32-bit Windows].
* *cygwin* - From link:https://cygwin.com/install.html[the Cygwin download site].

For other operating systems, curl.haxx.se supports link:https://curl.haxx.se/download.html[dozens more systems]. In addition, you can get curl add-ins for the Chrome browser.

Mac/Linux command line:

[source]
----
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "key": "TestKey01", "value": "This is an object store test" }' "http://<application_name>.cloudhub.io/store"
----

Change `<application_name>` to the name you chose when you deployed your application. Each time you submit this command, change the key's name so that each key is unique.
