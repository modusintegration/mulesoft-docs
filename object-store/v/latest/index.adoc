= Anypoint Object Store V2 - Beta
:keywords: osv2, object store, object, store

Object Store v2 lets applications store data and states across batch processes, Mule components, 
within a single application. OSv2 acts as the backend for Mule 3 and Mule 4 object store access, which 
enables applications to write directly to object store, use its REST API, and write and read using 
the Object Store connector.

Object Store v2 provides:

* Persistent storage of objects with a flexible TTL of up to 30 days
* Support for key-value objects
* Fully integrated with the Anypoint Platform
* Full HA across availability zones within a region
* Mule connector for Mule applications and REST interface for external applications
* End-to-end secure transport and storage
* Stores values up to 10 MB in size
* Confirmable timeout to enable rollbacks

You can use the existing Object Store Connector to create applications that write data to the object store.

Object Store v2 contains a user interface available from the
Anypoint Platform > Runtime Manager:

== About Migrating from Object Store v1 to v2

* Back up all the data in your current object store.
* In Anypoint Platform, click Runtime Manager.
* Click the name of your application to view the application's dashboard, and click Manage Application. In the Settings screen, click Use Object Store v2. Accept the prompt. The Application Data section of the Runtime Manager's Dashboard changes to Object Store.

== Object Store Notes

* The Object Store Connector works for both Object Store version 1 and 2. Similarly, a curl command to 
access Object Store v1 works the same in v2.
* OSv2 enforces a maximum data persistence of 30 days from time of creation.
* OSv2 permits values up to 10 MB.
* Other limits on the number of keys and data per application vary by license.
