= Tutorial: Object Store v2
:keywords: object store, tutorial

This document helps you use Object Store v2 (OSv2) to store and view data.

== Prerequisites

link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/object-store-connector[View the Object Store Connector guide] and 
link:/release-notes/objectstore-release-notes[Release Notes]. Also review the https://mulesoft.github.io/objectstore-connector/[Object Store Technical Reference].

== To Install the Object Store Connector

. In Anypoint Studio, click the Exchange icon in the Studio taskbar.
. Click Login in Anypoint Exchange.
. Search for the ObjectStore connector and click Install.
. Follow the prompts to install the connector.

Updates: When Studio has an update, a message displays in the lower right corner, which you can click to install the update.

== Create a Studio Project

. Open Anypoint Studio and create a new project using File > New > Mule Project. In this tutorial, the project name is `objstoredemo`.
. Create an application like this:
+

+
. Search for `http` and drag and drop the HTTP connector onto the Studio Canvas. The HTTP connector listens for the curl command we use to store a key and value in Object Store.
+
Click the green plus to the right of Connector Configuration and in the Global Element Properties screen, take the default settings (Host: 0.0.0.0 and Port: 8081) and click OK:
+

+
. In the HTTP properties screen, set Path to `/store` and Allowed Methods to `POST`:
+

+
When we submit our curl command, we use the `/store` option in our URL,
for example, `objectstoredemo.cloudhub.io/store`. The Allowed Methods setting ensures that those using our curl command can only POST information to the object store. 
+
. Locate and add the Object to String component to the Studio Canvas. No settings are necessary -- this component converts the content received from the HTTP connector into a string.
. Locate and add the JSON to Object component. Set the Return Class to `java.util.Map`:
+

+
. Search for `objectstore` and add the ObjectStore connector. If there is no object store connector,
install it as described in <<To Install the Object Store Connector>>.
.. Click the green plus sign to the right of Connector Configuration and in the Global Element Properties screen,
assign a Partition name, such as MyPartition. Leave the remaining settings blank, and click OK.
.. Set the Operation to Store and set these Store operation values:
** Key to `#[payload.key]`
** Value Reference to `#[payload.value]`
+

+
. Locate and add Set Payload. Set the Value field to `KEY: #[payload.key] AND VALUE: #[payload.value] WERE SAVED OK` - this message displays on the command line to let you know the curl command values are received by the application.
+

+
. Save the application and click Run > Run As > Mule Application. Running the application ensures your application works correctly. If you need to fix anything, do so now. After your application runs correctly, you can stop your application.

=== To Deploy Your Application in Anypoint Platform

. In Anypoint Platform > Runtime Manager, go to the Production environment and stop an application to free
up a Runtime Manager worker so that you can complete this demo.
. In Studio, right-click your application's name in Package Explorer and click
Anypoint Platform > Deploy to Cloud.
. At the User login window, specify your Anypoint Platform username and password, and click Sign in. If you don't have an Anypoint Platform login, click Sign up.
. In Runtime Manager:
+
** Specify an application a name. Each name is unique and becomes the URL under which your application
is available in Runtime Manager. The URL has the APPLICATION_NAME.cloudhub.io format where your application resides
in the cloudhub.io namespace. Ensure the application name gets a green checkmark for proper naming and being unique.
** Set the Runtime Version. Ensure that the Runtime exposes the *Use Object Store v2* checkbox, for example, 
version 3.7.5 exposes the checkbox whereas version 3.9.0 does not.
** Click the Use Object Store v2 checkbox.
+

+
. After configuring your application, click Deploy Application.
. After your application deploys, open the browser view, and click the right side of the entry to view details.
. Click the down arrow next to Undeployed and click Start. Starting may take a few minutes to occur.

== Sending Data to the Object Store

From a command line prompt, use a utility to send JSON data to your Mule application. This can be a command such as
curl, Postman, or a browser extension. Any serializable data can be sent to the 
object store. The object store connector sends data as key/value pairs. 

Example using curl:

[source]
----
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "key": "TestKey01", "value": "This is an object store test" }' "http://APPLICATION_NAME.cloudhub.io/store"
----

Change APPLICATION_NAME to the name you chose when you deployed your application. Each time you submit this command, change the key's name so that each key is unique.

== Viewing Data in the Object Store

To view data in the Object Store:

. Log into Anypoint Platform and click Runtime Manager.
. Click the name of your application to view the application's dashboard.
. Click Object Store from the left navigation bar:

+
The Object Store user interface appears as follows:
+

+
. Click the Object Store name. You can click a key name to view its value.
. You can delete keys by clicking the Key down-arrow symbol:
