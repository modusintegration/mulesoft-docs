= To Migrate to Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, Version 1.5.x to 1.6.1

This topic describes how to migrate from Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition version 1.5.x to version 1.6.1. These procedures are applicable to 1, 3, and 6 node installation.

[WARNING]
During the migration process, there may be some downtime as each node is migrated.

== Prerequisites

Before migrating, ensure that you have performed and met the following prerequisites:

* Perform a backup of your system as described in link:backup-and-disaster-recovery[About Backup and Recovery].

* Ensure that your environment meets all of the system and network requirements described in link:system-requirements[About Minimum System Requirements]

* Enable TCP ports `5973`, `3022`, `7373` intra-node to enable communication with the database cluster.

* Ensure you have permission to run the `sudo` command on the node where you launch the migration tool.

* Ensure the `kubectl` command is available in the node where you are performing the migration. To verify that `kubectl` is installed, run the following:
+
----
$ sudo gravity enter
$ kubectl
----

== Performing the Upgrade

. Obtain the `anypoint-1.6.1-installer.tar.gz` archive from your customer support representative.

. Determine the master node of your cluster.

             ├─gravity__gravitational.io__planet-master__0.1.39-138.service
----

. Use `ssh` to login to the master node of your cluster.

. Upload the installer to the master node of your cluster.

. Uncompress the installer archive.
+
----
mkdir anypoint-1.6.1
tar -xzf anypoint-1.6.1-installer.tar.gz -C installer-1.6.1
----

. Navigate to the `anypoint-1.6.1` directory, then run the upload script.
+
----
cd anypoint-1.6.1
sudo ./upload
----
+
This command updates the platform to the current version and restarts each pod in the cluster.
