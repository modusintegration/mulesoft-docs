= Deployment Status Reference
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments

When creating Mule applications in Design Center, there's a status indicator in the top navbar that shows the state of your application as it's being deployed. It also displays alerts about possible errors with the deployment.



The table below lists all the possible states for this indicator and their meanings.
