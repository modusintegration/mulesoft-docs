= To Log Data (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments


To log data from the execution of a Mule application:

. In Design Center add a Logger to your flow.

. Click the Function button next to the Message field image:logger-task-design-center-0a147.png[]

+
By changing the mode to Function you can provide something dynamic, instead of static text.

. Write a DataWeave expression in the Message field. You expression can include references to parts of the input and functions. For example, write `payload` to log the contents of the Mule message payload.

. Leave the Level as INFO, unless you want to tag the recorded information differently when logged.

. Click the Deploy button to deploy your application to a Design environment.

. Trigger the flow by sending a mock request to it.

. Expand the *Logs* tab at the bottom of the screen.

This tab displays the logs produced by the Logger components in your project, along with messages related to the deploying and running of the app.


== Expressions for Logging Dynamic Messages

Below are some examples of expressions you can write in the Message field of the Logger.

Note that you must click the Function button image:logger-task-design-center-0a147.png[] before writing any of these.

[TIP]
Without clicking the Function button, what you enter is considered static text unless you wrap your expression in `#[]`. Wrapping your text in `#[]` is equivalent to clicking the Function button.
