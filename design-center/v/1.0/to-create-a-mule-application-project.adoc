. Select *Mule Application*.

. Name your project.


. Select the target environment for designing and debugging the application.

[NOTE]
====
For this initial stage, you can only pick design environments. Once your application is ready, you can promote it to any production or sandbox environment that you have access to.

Through the use of design environments, you can keep your works-in-progress safely away from the public eye until they're ready to be promoted to production.
====

== Duplicate a Project

You can clone existing projects. These retain configurations, custom data types and sample data from the original.

. Select an existing project.

. On the sidebar on the right, click the duplicate icon image:to-create-a-mule-application-project-cfeff.png[].

. Name your new project.

. Select the target environment for designing and debugging the application.
