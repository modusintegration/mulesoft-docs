= About Designing a Mule Application (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart


Design Center allows you to create projects for the Mule Runtime. These projects consist of a series of modular components that are chained together into flows. Each component receives an input, carries out a specific function, and then transfers the output to the next component in a flow.

In Design Center, these components are represented as _cards_. The order in which they are placed matters, as information flows through them from left to right.

You can open any of these cards by clicking them, and configuring their fields. You can also drag cards to reorder them in the flow. Several of these components also reference *Configuration elements*, which define properties that may be shared amongst multiple instances of a type of card.


Flows only perform their actions when triggered, for example:

* When the first component listens for outside events, such as incoming HTTP requests.
* When the first element is a Scheduler, the flow executes at a given time or at a set time interval dictated by the Scheduler.
* When a flow is triggered from another flow via flow reference.



The structure of the data that enters and leaves each of these components can be defined through *Data Types*, and this information can then be used by other components.


You can run your project as a Mule application on a cloud server in a design environment. With this environment in mind, you can periodically push changes to test and debug it as you build the application. When your application is ready for production, you can promote it to a production server.
