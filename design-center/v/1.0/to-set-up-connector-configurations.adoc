= To Set Up Connector Configurations (Design Center)

== About Connector Configurations

By design, in Design Center connector configurations are separated from the settings found in a connector component.

This design allows projects to utilize several instances of the same connector; every instance points to the same base settings and therefore allows you to configure the connector only once.

For example: you could have multiple HTTP Request components in your project: /order/bread, /order/milk, /order/tea. All of these components rely on the same host, port and SSL certificates, but differ in their subpaths. Therefore, the host, port and SSL information is defined in one HTTP Configuration that serves as a connector reference for all of your HTTP Request components.

== Create a Connector Configuration

. Give your configuration a *Configuration Name*. This will come in handy if you want to apply this same configuration to another similar element in your project.

. Provide any other necessary fields and click *Save*

[NOTE]
If you create any more components of the same type in your project, these will automatically reference the existing configuration unless you specify otherwise.
