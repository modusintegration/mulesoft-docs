In Design Center, you can create and publish reusable projects of type API specification or API fragment. RAML defines documents of these types something like this:

* API specification
+
A RAML API definition document that begins with the text `#%RAML` followed by a single space and the version number `1.0`. 
+
* API fragment
+ 
A document, such as a data type, that begins with the RAML version and includes a fragment identifier.

You can publish an API fragment in Exchange and add it to your specification as a dependency. You can change the fragment outside the specification, update the fragment version in the specification, and reuse the fragment in other specifications.

To create and publish an API specification or fragment, you need to have the permissions covered in "User Access to Design Center." 

== OAS Support

Design Center supports the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) and the Open API Specification (OAS) 2.0, also known as Swagger. You can import an OAS specification to convert the OAS code to RAML. You can edit the resulting RAML code in the RAML editor.
