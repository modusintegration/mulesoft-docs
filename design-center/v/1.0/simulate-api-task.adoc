= To Simulate Calling a RAML API

link:/getting-started/api-lifecycle-overview#which-version[_Requires November 2017 Release_]

This procedure builds on the Placeholder API example. Simulating calls to the API is a critical design task that helps you troubleshoot problems and demo the API to prospective users even before you have implemented it. To simulate calls to the API, you can include the following things in the definition of a RAML resource:

* An example of data the actual implementation would return 
* An HTTP status code the API returns if successful

You can use the mocking service in API Console to provide a base URI for an API you haven't implemented yet. When you simulate a successful call to the API, the mocking service returns the status code 200 and example data. 

You see the response example from the JSON example when you preview the /users resource. 

. After entering RAML code in the editor, click the hamburger menu to display resources.

. Turn on Mocking Service on the top, right to simulate calls to the API.

In your RAML definition, the baseUri changes to a mocking service URI.
+
. Expand resources to see methods. Click GET. Try It appears.

. Click Try It. Click Send to return the example data.
+
The user information in the `/users` resource appears.
+
. Click the GET tab for the `/userbyid` resource. Click Try it.
. Check Show Optional Parameters, and accept the default query parameter ID = 3. Click Send.
+
The user information appears for the user having an ID 3.
