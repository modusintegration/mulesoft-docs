= To Change the Target Output of a Transformation (Design Center)
:keywords:

By default, the Transform component directs output to the payload of the Mule message object. You can change the target of the transformation to a variable or attribute if you do not use DataWeave through Map. Map output is the field you are editing.

This procedure assumes that in Transform, in Output, Payload is selected.

. Select Add Transformation.
. Select Attributes or Variable.
. Type a name for the attribute or variable.
+
This action opens a new transformation that sends output to the new target. The graphical, script, and preview view corresponds to the new transformation.

To remove the transformation that sends output to the Payload:

. In Output, click Attributes or Variable.
. Click Trash Can.
