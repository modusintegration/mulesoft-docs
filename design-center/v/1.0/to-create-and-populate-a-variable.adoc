= To Create and Populate a Variable (Design Center)

This first procedure in this topic creates a new variable and populates it with data that's returned by the operation. For example, you can set the variable to the response from the HTTP Request. The variable value is a Mule message object that overwrites the payload, not the main Mule message. A Mule message object contains:

* An attributes object that contains metadata about the nature of the data request. 
* A payload object that contains the actual data.

The second procedure in this topic creates a variable using Transform.

The scope of a variable is the Mule event. If you need variables to persist outside the event, use an object store. In this release, only one type of variable exists.


. Open any component that isn't acting as a flow trigger. For example, open an HTTP Request component.

. In Advanced, in the Target Variable, enter a name for the variable.

////
. Optional: open the *Output* tab of the operation (on the top margin), select the newly created variable and assign a Data Type to it.
////

You can access the saved payload downstream using the syntax:

`vars.MyVariableName.payload`


== Create a Variable Using Transform

. Add Transform to the flow, and hardcode a variable value to the name of the table you want to query:
+
* In Transform, on the Mappings tab, select Output Payload > Add Transformation.
+
* In Type, select Variable.
+
* In Name, enter a variable name, for example *cm_table*.
+
* Click Create.
+
* In the center of the Mappings pane, click Set Data Type.
+
* In Transform, in Data Type for Variables cm_table, select New Data Type.
+
* In Name, type a name, for example *tablename*.
+
* In Format, accept the default, JSON.
+
* In Type, select From Example and enter an example of a table name. For example, type the following string in quotation marks:
+
*"tablenamestring"*
+
* Apply Changes and then Keep Transformation.
* To populate the variable, in Output Variables - cmtable, double-click Variables String:
+
image::hardcode-var.png[Variables String,height=148,width=484]
+
* Replace the curly brackets with the table name enclosed in parentheses. For example, type *"payments"*.
+
Now, you can access the variable value, payments, from the Mule event in the next part of the flow using the expression vars.cm_table. For example, the following database connector Select operation selects all records from the payments table:
+
`'SELECT * FROM ' vars.cm_table`
