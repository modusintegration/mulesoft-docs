= To Create and Populate a Variable (Design Center)


Variables are a way to internally pass data along a flow to the next component. Variables belong to a Mule event, and can only be accessed through the Mule event in a flow; variables do not persist anywhere else in the Mule application.



== Create a Variable With an Operation


. Open any component that isn't acting as a flow trigger (ex: a HTTP Request component).

. Select the *Advanced* tab of this component.

. In the *Target Variable* field, write the name of your new variable.

////
. Optional: open the *Output* tab of the operation (on the top margin), select the newly created variable and assign a Data Type to it.
////

This creates a new variable and populates it with data that's returned by the operation. For example: on an HTTP Request operation, the response of the sent HTTP Request is recorded onto the variable as a Mule message object (which will overwrite the payload) instead of overwriting the main Mule message.

As a reminder, a Mule message object contains:

. An attributes object that contains metadata about the nature of the data request. 
. A payload object that contains the actual data.

You can access the saved payload downstream through using the syntax:

`variables.MyVariableName.payload`


== Create a Variable With the Transform Element

. Add a new Transform Component to your flow and open its properties

. On the output section, click the dropdown next to the output label (it should display "Output Payload" by default), and select *Add Transformation*.

. In the *Type* field, pick "Variable", and then give a name to your new variable.

. The Transform component now displays the transformation that outputs into your new variable. 

+
[NOTE]
Unlike other components, any variables created in the Transform component are *not* Mule message objects. These variables will directly contain the data from your transformation.

+
[NOTE]
If you don't want to process an extra transformation that outputs `payload` in this step, then you should delete the default transformation that the component created when you added it. To do so, open the dropdown next to the output label and click the trash can icon image:to-create-and-populate-a-variable-85dfe.png[] next to *Payload*.

. Define a link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-manage-data-types[Data Type] for your variable

. link:/design-center/v/1.0/graphically-construct-mapping-design-center-task[Construct a Mapping] of values from the input into your new variable.


Your new variable is created and populated with data from the input. The following components on your flow should have access to it.
