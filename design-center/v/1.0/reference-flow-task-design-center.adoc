= To Reference One Flow from Another (Design Center)

By placing a Flow Ref component in a flow you can execute one flow from another within the same application. When Flow Ref is executed, it triggers the referenced flow. The referenced flow executes and returns the Mule event object to the original flow where execution proceeds after the Flow Ref component. Flow Ref is handy for reusing groups of components within the same Mule application.

. In Design Center, create an initial flow that starts with a trigger, and add one or more components.
. Create a second flow:
+
* Click Flows - Plus.
+

+
* Rename the flow.
+

+
. Return to your first flow by clicking its name.

. Add a Flow Ref component anywhere in this flow. In the Flow field, select your second flow.

. In Flow Ref, click Go to go to second flow.
. Add components other than a trigger. The Flow Ref Component in the first flow triggers the second flow.
+
When your first flow is triggered, data is processed through this flow until the flow reaches the Flow Ref component. The entire second flow gets executed. After the second flow finishes executing, any components in the first flow, are executed.
