= Running an App Reference (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments

To start execution of an app, you do one of the following things, depending on the trigger type of the app:

* Deploy the app and then call the trigger as described in the flow design basic procedures.
* Just click Deploy.  A trigger, such as Scheduler, executes and re-executes your flow according to the schedule you configure.

The status of the deployment appears at the top of Design Center.

When running a app on a schedule, click Pause to prevent the app from re-executing endlessly. Pausing an app keeps the workspace active and the CloudHub resources in use. Restart Workspace deletes the current workspace and creates an empty new workspace. Restarting the workspace is sometimes required after a number of errors occur. After restarting a workspace or making changes to a project, click Deploy to redeploy the app. Changes then take effect. Select View in Runtime Manager to configure runtime operations.
