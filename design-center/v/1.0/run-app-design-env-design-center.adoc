= To Run an Application in a Design Environment (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments

Design Center allows you to deploy your applications and start running them without needing to leave the editing screen. You can use this feature as a way to rapidly test and debug your applications.


== Deploy to a Design Environment

. As soon as you create a Mule application project, a workspace in a design environment is reserved for your application.

+
[NOTE]
To deploy your application, your Anypoint Platform account must have at least one CloudHub worker with 0.2 Vcores available in the selected environment.

. On the top navbar, the status of your project changes to *Ready to Deploy*. Otherwise, the navbar indicates any errors in your project.

. Build out the flows of your application and set up every required field. The project must be free of errors before you can deploy it.

. Click the *Deploy* button, the application starts running as soon as it's deployed. When done, the status changes back to *Latest Changes Deployed*.

+
[NOTE]
As you keep making changes to your project, note that these don't affect your running application till you click the *Deploy* button.

. Once it's deployed, you can also configure finer details about the application through the Runtime Manager panel. To do so, click the options icon image:run-app-design-env-design-center-2428b.png[] next to the Deploy button and select *View in Runtime Manager*.



Once your application is running:

* Flows that begin with a HTTP Listener can be triggered by sending requests to the corresponding endpoint.

* Flows that begin with a Scheduler component trigger the flow at the selected interval or at the given time.

+
[NOTE]
====
Note that the Scheduler keeps triggering the flow until you pause or alter the application. 

Altering the project alone doesn't take effect till you Deploy changes to the running application.

See link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-debug-a-mule-project[To Debug a Mule Project] for more details on how to do this.
====

== Update an Application

Click the *Deploy* button on the top navbar. This pushes the current state of your project to overwrite what was previously deployed.


== Pause an Application

To pause the application, click the options icon image:run-app-design-env-design-center-2428b.png[] next to the Deploy button and select Pause. Note that this keeps the workerspace active and the CloudHub resources in use.

== Restart a Workspace

Click the options icon image:run-app-design-env-design-center-2428b.png[] next to the Deploy button and select Restart Workspace. This deletes the current workspace and creates an empty new workspace.

To upload your project to this new workspace, you must click Deploy once again.

[TIP]
This is the same as restarting the CloudHub worker in which your application is deployed.
