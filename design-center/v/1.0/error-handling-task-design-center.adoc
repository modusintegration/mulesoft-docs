= To Handle Errors With Try Scopes (Design Center)


You can put specific parts of a flow that are prone to errors inside a Try Scope. If an attempt to use this part of the flow fails, the scope can catch the errors and apply a fix or an alternative. Different types of errors can be handled differently within the same scope.

When you place a connector component inside a Try scope, you control what happens if an error occurs: send an error message, make corrections, or anything else that you can do in a flow.


. Add a Try Scope to your flow.

. Click the plus sign that's next to the Try block.

. Add and configure components, for example a Database Insert operation. You can add as many components as you want following it.

+
These components are used normally as part of the flow. If an error occurs while using these components, the Try Scope catches these errors and allows you to handle these errors.

. In the bottom-left section of the scope, open the card and provide a value for Type. You can either type in a value or select from a list of all possible errors that can occur on the components that you added above.

. Click the plus sign to the right of the error type to add components. The Try scope executes these components if the specific error is thrown.

== Adding More Error Types


. In an existing Try Scope, open the card and click the Options icon image:error-handling-task-design-center-018a5.png[].
. To add a new error type, select Add Above or Add Below.
+
Error conditions are matched from top to bottom, and only the first match is considered. If you add an error of type `ANY`, make sure that the error is listed last.

. Add an error type to the new card and add the components that should be used in case of an error.
