= To Set Data Types for a Flow

You can define data types for an entire flow to describe expected input and output. A Flow Ref element that references this flow exposes this metadata to the rest of the flow. With the metadata in place, you can generate code for the transformation of matching data using drag-and-drop mapping.

. Click Options image:reference-flow-task-design-center-b93f3.png[] next to the flow name.
