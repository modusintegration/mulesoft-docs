= To Define Input and Output Structure of a Transformation (Design Center)


To use the graphical view and construct mappings via drag and drop, the Transform component first needs information about what fields are available for dragging and dropping.

If you plan to create your transformation entirely by writing DataWeave source code, you can skip defining input and output and reference elements directly via code.


== Define Data Structure on Other Components


. Make sure that all other elements in the flow are fully configured.
+
When all other elements are configured and you have a component that has a predicted data structure, the structure can be passed onto the Transform component.

. Manually define input and output data structures if Design Center cannot predict the data structure.
+
For example, an HTTP Listener might receive requests containing any type of payload. If you know what this payload will look like, you can set the data type through the Input and Output tabs in the HTTP Listener dialog box.
+
See link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-manage-data-types[To Manage Data Types].


== Define Data Structures in the Transform Component

. Click Set Data Type:

* For the input pane, highlight the payload, attributes, or a variable and click the Set Data Type icon at the bottom of the input pane.

* For the output pane, select the Set data type button. If the output pane has an existing data type, click the drop-down arrow at the top of the Output pane to set a new data type.


. Manually define the data structure by providing a sample or a schema.

== Reader Configuration

In case your input needs to be parsed in a special way, you can set up certain properties for the reader object. Each input format has different configurable properties, or none. There are two ways to set these listed below.

* Configure other components on the flow, by accessing their corresponding Metadata tab.

* On the Transform component, right click on the root of the input pane and select *Reader Configuration*

[NOTE]
This option only exists if the selected data type format allows for configurable reader properties. If the payload is of type `unknown`, you must change its type first.


For a detailed reference of what properties can be set in the Reader Configuration of each format, see the corresponding *reader properties* section:

[NOTE]
You can also add this information through properties in the XML source of your Mule project.


== Writer Configuration

In case your output needs to be constructed in a special way, you can set up certain properties of the writer object. Each output format has different configurable properties, or none.

These properties must be written on the `output` directive of your DataWeave code.

For a detailed reference of what properties can be set in the Writer Configuration of each format, see the corresponding *reader properties* section:
