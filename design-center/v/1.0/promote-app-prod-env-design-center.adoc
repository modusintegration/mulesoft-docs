= To Promote an App to an Environment (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments

When your app is ready to publish, you can promote it to any environment in your Anypoint organization. For example, a staging database for apps can live in the staging environment, while the production database lives in the production environment. This eliminates the need to add property placeholders.

Promoting an app to a selected environment might give your app more exposure than you think, so determine the consequences of each promotion. 


. Click Promote Application image:deploying-your-project-a675b.png[]

. Select a name for running your application and the CloudHub environment to promote the application to.

. Set up the connector configurations of your project for the new environment.

Connector configuration fields are the same from one environment to another. 

After the promotion, you can go to Runtime Manager to manage the application.
