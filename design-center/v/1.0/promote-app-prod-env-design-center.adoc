= To Promote an App to an Environment (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart, deploy, environments

When an app that you develop in the design environment is ready to publish, you can promote it to another environment, such as production. As an Organization Administrator, you can restrict environments to certain users and resources. Promoting an app to a selected environment might give your app public exposure, depending on the setup of the environment.

After the promotion, you can go to Runtime Manager to manage the application.
