= About Flow Components (Design Center)

A flow performs operations specified by its components when triggered. For example:

* An HTTP listener at the beginning of a flow gets an outside event, an incoming HTTP request, which starts the flow.
* A Scheduler at the beginning of a flow starts the flow at a configured time or restarts the flow after an elapsed time.
* A Flow Ref in one flow starts another flow by referencing its name.

A flow needs a trigger unless started by a Flow Ref in another flow. 

Each component receives an input, carries out a specific function, and then transfers the output to the next part of the flow. The placement of components in a flow affects functionality. 

== Adding a Component to a Flow

First, you choose and configure a trigger for a flow.

Next, you click Plus image:arrange-cards-flow-design-center-e256e.png[] to select the next component. 

You can filter the list of components to show only modules or only APIs:

After you choose a module or API, you set properties and methods if necessary. Information image:helper-tooltips-icon.png[] provides tooltips about component fields.

== Reusing Components

Configuration of components is independent of operations, so you can reuse the configurations. For example, you can use the same database configuration, but different SQL operations, in multiple database connector instances. Multiple HTTP connectors can use the same host, port, and SSL certificates, but request data from different URLs: /order/bread, /order/milk, /order/tea. The host, port and TLS information is defined in one HTTP configuration and the subpaths in the HTTP operation.

Some modules, such as Try and For Each, do not perform any actions on their own, but affect the behavior of modules you put inside of them. 

You can nest some modules inside others using the inner Plus: image:arrange-cards-flow-design-center-e256e.png[height=23, width=23]

You drag a module to change its position in the flow.
