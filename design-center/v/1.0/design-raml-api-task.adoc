= To Design a RAML API Specification

link:/getting-started/api-lifecycle-overview#which-version[_Requires Crowd Release_]

This procedure covers how to design an API that consumes the free online REST service JSONPlaceholder. The API has two resources: `/users` and `/usersbyid`. You can call the API to request information about all users, or using an HTTP query parameter, to request information about a particular user. You can download the example code for this procedure from the "Download" section at the end of this topic.

. In Anypoint Platform, click Design Center. Set up a project to create a new API specification:
+
* In Projects, click Create. Select API Specification.
+
* In New API Specification, type a name for your new project. For example, type placeholder. Click Create.
+
The project opens for design in the master branch. Two lines of code based on the title and version of the API appear in the RAML editor.
+
. In the RAML editor, go to the next blank line (3).
+
The possible entries you can make appear as options. Click to enter and correctly indent an option into the code.
+
image::designer-shelf.png[baseURI,height=374,width=414]
+
If you don't see these options, click image:down-angle-bracket.png[down angle bracket].
+
. At the root level, click Root > baseUri from the list of options. Enter 
`+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+`.
+
. Go to the next line of code, and include a resource in the RAML. Indent the resource at the same level as the `baseUri`.
+
For example, create a `/users` resource:
+
----
...
baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
/users:
----
+
. Enter the GET method to retrieve the information defined in `+http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com+`. Put the method name followed by a colon on the lines below the resource name, indented one level. Indent and add a description on of the method on the next line. For example:
+
----
/users:
  get:
    description: Retrieve a list of all the users
----
. Include HTTP responses in the RAML for simulating the API:
+
----
responses:
      200:
        body:
----
+
At this point, the API definition looks like this:
+
----
#%RAML 1.0
title: placeholder
baseUri: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
/users:
  get:
    description: Retrieve a list of all the users
    responses:
      200:
        body:
----
+
. Download the `user-example.json` from the "Downloads" section of this document and create an include file of the JSON code:
* Select Files > image:dependencies-plus.png[+] > New File.
* Select Other from the drop-down and name the file *user-example.json*. Click Submit.
+
The file at this point is empty.
+
* Copy the contents of user-example.json and paste it into the editor:
+
image::user-example-in-dc.png[raml example,height=334,width=603]
+
* In the RAML editor, type add the following lines to the code:
+
----
...
      application/json:
        example: !include user-example.json
----
. At one indentation from the root, define the following resource:
+
----
  /userbyid:
    get:
      description: Get information about a particular user
      queryParameters:
        id:
          description: Specify the id of the user you want to retrieve
          type:        integer
          required:    false
          example: 3
      responses:
        200:
          body:     
            application/json:
----
+
. Download the RAML code for this task, and add the example for the `/userbyid` resource.
