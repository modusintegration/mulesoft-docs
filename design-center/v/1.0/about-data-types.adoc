= About Data Types (Design Center)
:keywords: mozart


== Overview

When building an integration application, one of the biggest challenges is to know what data is available at every step of the process way and how to reference that data.

* Is what I need available as a simple string or is it an item on an array? 
* Is it deep within the structure of an object? 
* What parent elements do I need to reference to reach my target data? 

In Design Center, you don't need to guess the answers to any of these questions because  _metadata_ that flows through your application is easily available to you while you develop your application.


Every component has an input and an output. The actual contents of the data may be unknown until the application is running and processing data, but what can be known is the _data type_.


Some components, such as a Salesforce component, are self-explanatory because Salesforce objects have a well-defined structure that Design Center can easily reference. 

Other components, such as the HTTP Request component, could have inputs and outputs of any data type. In these cases, you need to manually configure Design Center link:/design-center/v/1.0/to-manage-data-types[with the appropriate data type] for later reference.


== Benefits of Defining Data Types

Once Design Center knows what your data type is, it can aid you in the following ways:

* The cards in the flow visibly display the metadata.

* You get contextual autocomplete suggestions while you link:/design-center/v/1.0/provide-values-fields-design-center[Provide Values for Fields], based on the available metadata.

* You can visually map data by simply dragging and dropping elements from the input to the output. This functionality is available both in the link:/design-center/v/1.0/transform-message-component-concept-design-center[Transform] component and in other components on any field where you see a link:/design-center/v/1.0/provide-values-fields-design-center#map-button[Map button].

[NOTE]
The handling of metadata in Design Center relies on having an available CloudHub worker to process backend requirements. Until the application is in _Running_ status, this data won't be available. If your Anypoint Platform account doesn't have an available CloudHub worker on a Design environment, then this functionality will not work.

== Data Type Visualization

As data transitions through the components of a flow, it gets processed and gets transformed. When information is available to Design Center about what is changed, the changes are displayed on every card.

The elements that make up the Mule Event are displayed on each card, the Payload, its Attributes and each of the Variables. In each component of the flow, these elements can be created, deleted, edited or kept unchanged. This is indicated via the following icons:

* *+* : created

* triangle icon: edited

* *-* : deleted

* nothing: unchanged
