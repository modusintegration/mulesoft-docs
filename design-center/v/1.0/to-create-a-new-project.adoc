. Select *Mule Application*.

. Name your project

+
[NOTE]
A known issue exists that prevents you from renaming an existing project in the project list. Name changes do not persist.




. Select the Design Environment for designing and debugging the application.
+
Once your application is ready, you can promote it to any production or sandbox environment.

+
[TIP]
Through the use of multiple environments, you can keep your works-in-progress safely away from the public eye until they're ready to be promoted to production.
