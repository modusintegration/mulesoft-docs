= Transactions View

The Transactions View is the default view for B2B Transactions page.

== Content Area

The Content Area displays a table consisting of rows, each of which presents data specific to a transaction.

===  Transaction rows

Each row has five columns, each of which present data about a specific type of data.

Column 1 (not labeled): Transaction completion status:: Contains either a green checkmark or a red '!'.
* A green checkmark means the transaction was successful
* A red '!' means that an error occurred somewhere in the transaction.

Column 2 (not labeled): Replay status:: This column may contain:
* A blue partial circle with an arrowhead pointing right, which means that the transaction has been replayed
* A gray partial circle with an arrowhead pointing left, which means that the transaction is a replay of another transaction
* A gray circle with two sequential arrows, which means the transaction is currently being replayed

Column 3 (From):: The partner from whom the transaction originated

Column 4 (To):: To whom the transaction was destined

Column 5 (Date):: Date and time at which the transaction occurred
